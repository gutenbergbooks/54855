    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he leading
      character in this book is represented, dramatically, as resembling, both
      in his strength and weakness, the great Abelard of history. For this very
      reason he is described as failing miserably, where a stronger man might
      never have foiled, in grasping the Higher Rationalism as a law for life.
      He is, in fact, not meant for an ideal hero, but for an ardent
      intellectual man, hopelessly biased against veracity both by temperament
      and hereditary superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make this explanation in order to be beforehand with those who will
      possibly hasten to explain to my readers that my philosophy of life is at
      best retrograde, my modern thinker an impressionable spoony, and my
      religious outlook taken in the shadow of the Churches and reading no
      farther than the cloudy horizons of Ober-Ammergau.

      And thro&rsquo; her riven sides with ceaseless rush

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n a windy night in
      the month of May, the full moon was flashing from cloud to cloud, each so
      small that it began to melt instantaneously beneath her hurried breath;
      and, in the fulness of the troubled light that she was shedding, the
      bright tongues of the sea were creeping up closer and closer through the
      creeks of the surrounding land, till they quivered like quicksilver under
      the walls of Mossleigh Abbey, standing dark and lonely amongst the Fens.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a night when, even in that solitude, everything seemed mysteriously
      and troublously alive. The wind cried as with a living voice, and the
      croaks of herons answered from the sands, The light of the moon went and
      came as to a rhythmic respiration; and when it hashed, the bats were seen
      hitting with thin z-like cry high up over the waterside, and when it was
      dimmed the owl moaned from the ivied walls. At intervals, from the distant
      lagoons, came the faint &lsquo;quack, quack&rsquo; of flocks of ducks at feed. The
      night was still, but enchanted; subdued, yet quivering with sinister life.
      Over and above all was the heavy breath of the ocean, crawling nearer and
      nearer, eager yet fearful, with deep tremors, to the electric wand of that
      heavenly light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, from inland, came another sound&mdash;the quick tramp of a
      horse&rsquo;s feet coming along the narrow road which wound up to, and past, the
      abbey ruins. As it grew louder, it seemed that every other sound was
      hushed, and everything listened to its coming; till at last, out of the
      moonbeams and the shadows, flashed a tall white horse, ridden by a shape
      in black.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived opposite the ruins, the horse paused, and its rider, a woman,
      looked eagerly up and down the road, whereupon, as if at a signal, all the
      faint sounds of the night became audible again. The woman sat still,
      listening; and her face looked like marble. After pausing thus motionless
      for some minutes, she turned from the road, and walked her horse through
      the broken wall, across a stone-strewn field, and in through the gloomy
      arch of the silent abbey, till she reached the roofless space within,
      where the grass grew rank and deep, mingled with monstrous weeds, and
      running green and slimy over long neglected graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      How dark and solemn it seemed between those crumbling walls, which only
      the dark ivy seemed to hold together with its clutching sinewy fingers!
      yet, through each of the broken windows, and through every archway, the
      moonlight beamed, making streaks of luminous whiteness on the grassy
      floor. The horse moved slowly, at his own will, picking his way carefully
      among fragments of fallen masonry, and stopping short at times to inspect
      curiously some object in his path. All was bright and luminous overhead;
      all dim and ominous there below. At last, reaching the centre of the
      place, the horse paused, and its rider again became motionless, looking
      upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight pouring through one of the arched windows suffused her face
      and form.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a fair woman, fair and tall, clad in a tight-fitting riding dress
      of black, with black hat and backward-drooping veil. Her hair was golden,
      almost a golden red, and smoothed down in waves over a low broad forehead.
      Her eyes were grey and very large, her features exquisitely cut, her mouth
      alone being, perhaps, though beautifully moulded, a little too full and
      ripe; but let it be said in passing, this mouth was the soul of her face&mdash;large,
      mobile, warm, passionate, yet strangely firm and sweet. Looking into the
      grave eyes of this woman, you would have said she was some saint, some
      beautiful madonna; looking at her mouth and lips, you would have said it
      was the mouth of Cytherea, alive with the very fire of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat motionless, still gazing upward on the dim milky azure, flecked
      with the softest foam of clouds. Her face was bright and happy, patient
      yet expectant; and when the low sounds of the night were wafted to her
      ears, she sighed softly in unison, as if the sweetness of silence could be
      borne no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she started, listening, and at the same moment her horse, with
      dilated eyes and nostrils, trembled and pricked up his delicate ears.
      Clear and distinct, from the distance, came the sound of another horse&rsquo;s
      feet. It came nearer and nearer, then it ceased close to the abbey wall;
      and, almost simultaneously, the white steed threw forth his head and
      neighed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman smiled happily, and patted his neck with her gloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute passed. Then through the great archway slowly came another rider,
      a man. On seeing the first comer, he rose in the saddle and waved his
      hand; then leaping down, he threw his reins over an iron hook fixed in the
      wall, and came swiftly through the long grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall man of about thirty, wrapt in a dark riding cloak and wearing a
      broad-brimmed clerical hat. He was clean shaven, but his black hair fell
      about his shoulders. His eyes were black and piercing, his eyebrows thick
      and dark. The head, with its square firm jaw and fine aquiline features,
      was set firm upon a powerful neck and shoulders. His cloak, falling back
      from the throat, showed the white neckcloth worn by English clergymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white horse did not stir as he approached, but, turning his head,
      surveyed him calmly with an air of recognition. He came up, took the rein
      and patted the horse&rsquo;s neck, while the woman, with a cry of welcome, leapt
      from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I fasten your horse with mine?&rsquo; he asked, still holding the rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; let him ramble among the grass. He will come at my call.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Released and riderless, the horse moved slowly through the grass,
      approaching the other in a leisurely way, with a view to a little equine
      conversation. Meantime the man and woman had sprung into each other&rsquo;s
      arms, and were kissing each other like lovers&mdash;as indeed they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are late, dearest,&rsquo; said the woman presently, when the first delight
      of meeting was over. &lsquo;I thought perhaps you could not come to-night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was deep and musical&mdash;a soft contralto&mdash;with
      vibrations of infinite tenderness. As she stood with him, fixing her eyes
      fondly upon him, it almost seemed as if she, not he, were the masculine,
      the predominant spirit; he the feminine, the possessed. Strong and
      passionate as he seemed, he was weak and cold compared to her; and
      whenever they clung together and kissed, it seemed as if her kisses were
      given in the eagerness of mastery, his in the sweetness of self-surrender.
      This, seeing her delicate beauty, and the powerful determined face and
      form of the man, was strange enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not come earlier,&rsquo; he replied gently. &lsquo;I had a call to a dying
      man which detained me. I left his bedside and came straight hither.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is why you look so sad,&rsquo; she said, smiling and kissing him. &lsquo;Ah, yes&mdash;death
      is terrible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she clung to him fondly, as if fearful that the cold cruel shadow even
      then and there might come between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not always, Alma. The poor man whose eyes I have just closed&mdash;he was
      only a poor fenman&mdash;died with a faith so absolute, a peace so
      perfect, that all the terrors of his position departed, leaving only an
      infinite pathos. In the presence of such resignation I felt like an unholy
      intruder. He went away as calmly as if Our Lord came to him in the very
      flesh, holding out two loving hands&mdash;and, indeed, who knows? His eyes
      were fixed at last as if he <i>saw</i> something, and then... he smiled
      and passed away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved along side by side through the deep shadows. She held his hand
      in hers, drawing life and joy from the very touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a beautiful night!&rsquo; he said at last, gazing upwards thoughtfully.
      &lsquo;Surely, surely, the old argument is true, and that sky refutes the cry of
      unbelief. And yet men perish, generations come and go, and still that
      patient light shines on. This very place is a tomb, and we walk on the
      graves of those who once lived and loved as we do now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Their souls are with God,&rsquo; she murmured; &lsquo;yes, with God, up yonder!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amen to that. But when they lived, dearest, belief was so easy. They were
      not thrust into a time of doubt and change. It was enough to close the
      eyes and walk blindly on in assurance of a Saviour. Now we must stare with
      naked eyes at the Skeleton of what was a living Truth.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not say that. The truth lives, though its face has changed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Does</i> it live? God knows. Look at this deserted place, these ruined
      walls. Just as this is to habitable places, is our old faith to the modern
      world. Roofless, deserted, naked to heaven, stands the Church of Christ.
      Soon it must perish altogether, leaving not a trace behind; unless...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unless?...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unless, with God&rsquo;s aid, it can be <i>restored</i>,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Even
      then, perhaps, it would never be quite the same as it once was in the
      childhood of the world; but it would at least be a Temple, not a ruin.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;That is always your dream, Ambrose.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is my dream&mdash;and my belief. Meanwhile, I am still like a man
      adrift. O Alma, if I could only <i>believe</i>, like that poor dying man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do believe,&rsquo; she murmured; &lsquo;only your belief is not blind and
      foolish. Why should you reproach yourself because you have rejected so
      much of the old superstition?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I am a minister of the Church, round which, like that dark
      devouring ivy, the old superstitions still cling. Before you could make
      this place what it once was, a prosperous abbey, with happy creatures
      dwelling within it, you have to strip the old walls bare; and it is the
      same with our religion. I am not strong enough for such a task. The very
      falsehoods I would uproot have a certain fantastic holiness and beauty;
      when I lay my hands upon them, as I have sometimes dared to do, I seem to
      hear a heavenly voice rebuking me. Then I say to myself that perhaps,
      after all, I am committing an act of desecration; and so&mdash;my life is
      wasted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him earnestly during a long pause which followed. At last she
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not, perhaps, that you <i>think</i> of these things too much?
      Perhaps it was not meant that we should always fix our eyes on what is so
      mysterious. God hid himself away in the beginning, and it is not his will
      that we should comprehend him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman shook his head in deprecation of that gentle suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why did He plant in our souls such a cruel longing? Why did He tempt
      our wild inquiry, with those shining lights above us, with this wondrous
      world, with every picture that surrounds the soul of man? No, Alma, He
      does not hide himself away&mdash;it is we who turn our eyes from him to
      make idols of stone or flesh, and to worship these. Where, then, shall we
      find him? Not among the follies and superstitions of the ruined Church at
      the altar of which I have ministered to my shame!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His words had become so reckless, his manner so agitated, that she was
      startled. Struck by a sudden thought, she cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something new has happened? O Ambrose, what is it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;that is, little or nothing. The Inquisition has
      begun, that is all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a curious laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The clodhoppers of Fensea have, in their small way, the instinct of
      Torquemada. The weasel is akin to the royal tiger. My Christian
      congregation wish to deliver me over to the moral stake and faggot; as a
      preliminary they have written to my Bishop.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of what do they complain <i>now</i>?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I am a heretic,&rsquo; he answered with the same cold laugh.&rsquo; Conceive the
      ridiculousness of the situation! There was some dignity about heresy in
      the old days, when it meant short shrift, a white shirt, and the <i>auto-da-fé</i>.
      But an inquisition composed of Summerhayes the grocer, Hayes the saddler,
      and Miss Rayleigh the schoolmistress; and, instead of Torquemada, the mild
      old Bishop of Darkdale and Dells!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed too, but somewhat anxiously. Then she said tenderly, with a
      certain worship&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are too good for such a place. They do not understand you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner became serious in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have flattered my pride with such a thought, but, after all, have they
      not right on their side? They at least have a definite belief; they at
      least are satisfied to worship <i>in a ruin</i>, and all they need is an
      automaton to lead their prayers. When they have stripped me bare, and
      driven me from the church&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Ambrose, will they do that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly. It must come, sooner or later; perhaps the sooner the better.
      I am tired of my own hypocrisy&mdash;of frightening the poor fools with
      half-truths when the whole of the truth of unbelief is in my heart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you <i>do</i> believe,&rsquo; she pleaded; &lsquo;in God, and in our Saviour!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in the letter, dearest. In the spirit, certainly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The spirit is everything. Can you not defend yourself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not try. To attempt to do so would be another hypocrisy. I shall
      resign.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then? You will go away?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you will take <i>me</i> with you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her gently to him; he kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you share my degradation?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;A minister who rejects or
      is rejected by his Church is a broken man, broken and despised. In these
      days martyrdom has no glory, no honour. You yourself would be the first to
      feel the ignominy of my situation, the wretchedness of a petty
      persecution. It would be better, perhaps, for us to part.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But with a look of ineffable sweetness and devotion she crept closer to
      him, and laid her head upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall not part,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Where you go I shall follow, as Rachel
      followed her beloved. Your country shall be my country, dearest, and&mdash;your
      God my God!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All the troubled voices of the night responded to that loving murmur. The
      moon rose up luminous into the open heaven above the abbey ruins, and
      flashed upon the two clinging frames, in answer to the earth&rsquo;s
      incantation.

      the undersigned, churchwardens and parishioners of the Church of St. Mary
      Flagellant, in the parish of Fensea and diocese of Dells, feel it our duty
      to call your lordship&rsquo;s attention to the conduct of the Rev. Ambrose
      Bradley, vicar of Fensea aforesaid. It is not without great hesitation
      that we have come to the conclusion that some sort of an inquiry is
      necessary. For many months past the parish pulpit has been scandalised by
      opinions which, coming from the pulpit of a Christian church, have caused
      the greatest astonishment and horror; but the affair reached its
      culmination last Ascension Day, when the Vicar actually expressed his
      scepticism as to many of the Christian miracles, and particularly as to
      the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>in the flesh</i>. It is also
      reported, we believe on good authority, that Mr. Bradley is the author of
      an obnoxious article in an infidel publication, calling in question such
      facts as the miraculous conversion of the Apostle Paul, treating other
      portions of the gospel narrative as merely &lsquo;Symbolical,&rsquo; and classing the
      Bible as only one of many Holy Books with equal pretensions to Divine
      inspiration. Privately we believe the Vicar of Fensea upholds opinions
      even more extraordinary than these. It is for your lordship to decide,
      therefore, whether he is a fit person to fill the sacred office of a
      Christian minister, especially in these times, when Antichrist is busy at
      work and the seeds of unbelief find such ready acceptance, especially in
      the bosom of the young. Personally, we have no complaint against the
      Vicar, who is well liked by many of his congregation, and is very zealous
      in works of charity and almsgiving. But the pride of carnal knowledge and
      the vanity of secular approbation have turned him from that narrow path
      which leads to righteousness, into the howling wilderness of heterodoxy,
      wherein, having wandered too far, no man may again find his soul alive. We
      beseech your lordship to investigate this matter without delay; and, with
      the assurance of our deepest respect and reverence, we beg to subscribe
      ourselves, your lordship&rsquo;s humble and obedient servants,

      Vicar of Fensea.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkdale, May 28.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Bradley.&mdash;I have just received from some of the leading
      members of your congregation a communication of an extraordinary nature,
      calling in question, I regret to say, not merely your manner of conducting
      the sacred service in the church of Fensea, but your very personal
      orthodoxy in those matters which are the pillars of the Christian faith. I
      cannot but think that there is some mistake, for I know by early
      experience how ready churchgoers are, especially in the rural districts,
      to distort the significance of a preacher&rsquo;s verbal expressions on
      difficult points of doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you were first promoted to the living of Fensea, you were named to me
      as a young man of unusual faith and zeal&mdash;perfer-vid, indeed, to a
      fault; and I need not say that I had heard of you otherwise as one from
      whom your university expected great things. That is only a few years ago.
      What then has occurred to cause this sad misconception (I take it for
      granted that it <i>is</i> a misconception) on the part of your
      parishioners? Perhaps, like many other young preachers of undoubted
      attainments but limited experience, you have been trying your oratorical
      wings too much in flights of a mystic philosophy and a poetical rhetoric;
      and in the course of these flights have, as rhetoricians will, alarmed
      your hearers unnecessarily. Assuming this for a moment, will you pardon me
      for saying that there are two ways of preaching the gospel: one subtle and
      mystical, which appeals only to those spirits who have penetrated into the
      adytum of Christian theology; one cardinal and rational, which deals only
      with the simple truths of Christian teaching, and can be understood by the
      veriest child. Perhaps, indeed, of these two ways, the latter one most
      commends itself to God. &lsquo;For except a man be born again,&rsquo; <i>&amp;c</i>.
      Be that as it may, and certainly I have no wish to undervalue the
      subtleties of Christian philosophy, let me impress upon you that, where a
      congregation is childlike, unprepared, and as it were uninstructed, no
      teaching can be too direct and simple. Such a congregation asks for bread,
      not for precious stones of oratory; for kindly promise, not for mystical
      speculation. That you have seriously questioned, even in your own mind,
      any of the Divine truths of our creed, as expressed in that Book which is
      a light and a Jaw unto men, I will not for a moment believe; but I shall
      be glad to receive forthwith, over your own signature, an assurance that
      my surmise is a correct one, and that you will be careful in the future to
      give no further occasion for misconception.&mdash;I am, my dear Mr.
      Bradley, yours,
    </p>

      W. H. Darkdale and Dells.

    <p>
      <i>From the Rev. Ambrose Bradley to the Right Reverend the Bishop of
      Darkdale and Dells.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vicarage, May 31, 1880.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Bishop,&mdash;I am obliged to you for your kind though categorical
      letter, to which I hasten to give you a reply. That certain members of my
      congregation should have forwarded complaints concerning me does not
      surprise me, seeing that they have already taken me to task on many
      occasions and made my progress here difficult, if not disagreeable. But I
      think you will agree with me that there is only one light by which a
      Christian man, even a Christian clergyman, can consent to be directed&mdash;the
      light of his own conscience and intellect, Divinely implanted within him
      for his spiritual guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be quite candid with you. You ask what has changed me since the day
      when, zealous, and, as you say, &lsquo;perfervid,&rsquo; I was promoted to this
      ministry. The answer is simple. A deep and conscientious study of the
      wonderful truths of Science, an eager and impassioned study of the
      beautiful truths of Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seem to see you raise your hands in horror. But if you will bear with me
      a little while, perhaps I may convince you that what I have said is not so
      horrible after all&mdash;nay, that it expresses a conviction which exists
      at the present moment in the bosom of many Christian men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great question before the world just now, when the foundations of a
      particular faith are fatally shaken, when Science denies that Christ as we
      conceive Him ever was, and when Art bewails wildly that He should ever
      have been, is whether the Christian religion can continue to exist at all;
      whether, when a few more years have passed away, it will not present to a
      modern mind the spectacle that paganism once presented to a mediaeval
      mind. Now, of our leading Churchmen, not even you, my Lord Bishop, I feel
      sure, deny that the Church is in danger, both through attacks from without
      and through a kind of dry-rot within. Lyell and others have demolished and
      made ridiculous the Mosaic cosmogony Strauss and others have demolished,
      with more or less success, the Biblical and Christian miracles. No sane
      man now seriously believes that the sun ever stood still, or that an ass
      spoke in human speech, or that a multitude of people were ever fed with a
      few loaves and fishes, or that any solid human form ever walked on the
      liquid sea. With the old supernaturalism has gone the old asceticism or
      other-worldliness. It is now pretty well agreed that there are
      substantially beautiful things in this world which have precedence over
      fancifully beautiful things in the other. The poets have taught us the
      loveliness of Nature, the painters have shown us the loveliness of Art.
      Meantime, what does the Church do? Instead of accepting the new knowledge
      and the new beauty, instead of building herself up anew on the debris of
      her shattered superstitions, she buries her face in her own ashes, and
      utters a senile wail of protestation. Instead of calling upon her children
      to face the storm, and to build up new bulwarks against the rising wave of
      secularism, she commands them to wail with her, or <i>to be silent</i>.
      Instead of perceiving that the priests of Baal and Antichrist might
      readily be overthrown with the weapons forged by their own hands, she
      cowers before them powerless, in all the paralysis of superstition, in all
      the blind fatuity of prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us look the facts in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The teachers of the new knowledge have unroofed our Temple to the heavens,
      but have not destroyed its foundations; they have overthrown its brazen
      images, but have not touched its solid walls. Put the case in other and
      stronger words. The God who thundered upon Sinai has vanished into air and
      cloud, but the God of man&rsquo;s heavenly aspiration is wonderfully quickened
      and alive. The Bible of wrath and prophecy is cast contemptuously aside,
      but the Bible of eternal poetry is imperishable, its wild dreams and
      aspirations being crystallised in such literature as cannot die. The
      historic personality of the gentle rounder of Christianity becomes fainter
      and fainter as the ages advance; but, on the other hand, brighter and
      fairer grows the Divine Ideal which rose from the ashes of that godlike
      man. Men reject the old miracles, but they at last accept a miracle of
      human idealism. In one word, though Christianity has perished as a
      dogmatic faith, it survives as the philosophic religion of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being so, how does it behove a Christian minister, eating the
      Church&rsquo;s bread, but fully alive to her mortal danger, to steer his course?
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall he, as so many do, continue to act in the nineteenth century as he
      would have acted in the fifteenth, or indeed in any century up to the
      Revolution? Shall he base his teaching on the certainty of miracles, on
      the existence of supernaturalism, on the evil of the human heart, the
      vanity of this world, and the certainty of rewards and punishments in
      another? Shall he brandish the old hell fire, or scatter the old heavenly
      manna?
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think so!
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing in his heart that these things are merely the cast-off epidermis
      of a living and growing creed, he may, in perfect consciousness of God&rsquo;s
      approval, put aside the miraculous as unproven if not irrelevant; warn the
      people against mere supernaturalism; proclaim with the apostles of the
      Renaissance the glory and loveliness of <i>this</i> world&mdash;its
      wondrous scenes, its marvellous story as written on the rocks and in the
      stars, its divine science, its literature, its poetry, and its art; and
      treading all the fire of Hell beneath his feet, and denouncing the threat
      of eternal wrath as a chimera, base his hope of immortality on the moral
      aspirations that, irrespective of dogma, are common to all mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I think he may do, and must do, if the Church is to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let him do this, and let only a tithe of his brethren imitate him in so
      doing, and out of this nucleus of simple believers, as out of the little
      Galilean band, may be renewed a faith that will redeem the world.
      Questioned of such a faith, Science will reply&mdash;&lsquo;I have measured the
      heavens and the earth, I have traced back the book of the universe page by
      page and letter by letter, but I have found neither here nor yonder any
      proof that God is <i>not;</i> nay, beyond and behind and within all
      phenomena, there abides one unknown quantity which you are quite free to
      call&mdash;God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly questioned, Art will answer&mdash;&lsquo;Since you have rejected what
      was so hideous, tested by the beauty of this world, and since you hold
      even my work necessary and holy, I too will confess with you that I hunger
      for something fairer and less perishable; and in token of that hunger, of
      that restless dream, I will be your Church&rsquo;s handmaid, and try to renew
      her Temple and make it fair.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The keystone of the Church is Jesus Christ. Not the Jesus of the miracles,
      not Jesus the son of Joseph and Mary, but Jesus Christ, the Divine Ideal,
      the dream and glory of the human race. Not God who made himself a man, but
      man who, by God&rsquo;s inspiration, has been fashioned unto the likeness of a
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what, as we behold him now, is this Divine Ideal&mdash;this man made
      God?
    </p>
    <p>
      He is simply, as I conceive, the accumulated testimony of human experience&mdash;of
      history, poetry, philosophy, science, and art&mdash;in favour of a
      rational religion, the religion of earthly peace and heavenly love. Built
      upon the groundwork of what, shorn of its miraculous pretensions, was a
      gentle and perfect life, the Divine Ideal, or Ideal Person, began. At
      first shadowy and almost sinister, then clearer and more beautiful; then,
      descending through the ages, acquiring at every step some new splendour of
      self-sacrifice, some new consecration of love or suffering, from every
      heart that suffered patiently, from every soul that fed the lamp of a
      celestial dream with the oil of sweet human love. And now, far removed as
      is man himself from the archetypal ape, is the Christ of modern
      Christendom, this spiritual Saviour of the world, from the ghostly
      skeleton of the early martyrs, from the Crucified One of early Christian
      art. The life of generations has gone to fashion him&mdash;all our human
      experience has served to nourish him&mdash;gradually from age to age He
      has drunk in the blood of suffering and the milk of knowledge, till He
      stands supreme as we see him&mdash;not God, but man made God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does it matter so much, after all, whether we worship a person or an idea,
      since, as I suggest, the Idea has become a Person, with all the powers and
      privileges of divinity? Nay, who in this world is able, even with the help
      of philosophy, to distinguish what <i>is</i> from what seems&mdash;the
      phenomenal from the real? So long as Our Lord exists as a moral
      phenomenon, so long in other words as we can apprehend him as an ideal of
      human life, Christ is not dead, and his resurrection is not a dream. He
      walks the world. He remembers Greece and Rome, as well as Galilee; He
      blesses the painter and the poet, as well as the preacher in the Temple.
      He rejects nothing; He reads the rocks and the stars, and He adds their
      gospel to his own; He cries to men of all creeds, as his prototype cried
      to his disciples of yore, &lsquo;Come unto me, all ye that are heavy laden, and
      ye shall rest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pardon me, my Lord Bishop, the desultory thoughts noted down in this long
      letter. They perhaps give you some clue as to the sentiments with which I
      pursue the Christian mission. You will doubtless think me somewhat
      heterodox, but I have at least the courage of my opinions; and on some
      such heterodoxy as mine&mdash;though on one, I hope, much broader and
      wiser&mdash;it will soon be found necessary to reconstruct the Christian
      Church, I am, my Lord Bishop, yours,
    </p>

      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the morning of
      June 2 the Rev. Ambrose Bradley left Fensea by the early market train, and
      arrived at Darkdale just in time for his interview with the Bishop of his
      diocese.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seen in broad daylight, as he quickly made his way through the narrow
      streets to the episcopal residence, Bradley looked pale and troubled, yet
      determined. He was plainly drest, in a dark cloth suit, with broad felt
      hat; and there was nothing in his attire, with the exception of his white
      clerical necktie, to show that he held a sacred office. His dress, indeed,
      was careless almost to slovenliness, and he carried a formidable
      walking-stick of common wood. With his erect and powerful frame and his
      closely shaven cheeks he resembled an athlete rather than a clergyman, for
      he had been one of the foremost rowers and swimmers of his time. He wore
      no gloves, and his hands, though small and well formed, were slightly
      reddened by the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at his destination, an old-fashioned residence, surrounded by a
      large garden, he rang the gate bell, and was shown by a footman into the
      house, where his card was taken by a solemn-looking person clerically
      attired. After waiting a few moments in the hall, he was ushered into a
      luxuriously furnished study, where he found the Bishop, with his nether
      limbs wrapt in rugs, seated close to a blazing fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was a little spare man of about sixty,
      with an aquiline nose, a slightly receding forehead, a mild blue eye, and
      very white hands. He was said to bear some facial likeness to Cardinal
      Newman, and he secretly prided himself upon the resemblance. He spoke
      slowly and with a certain precision, never hurrying himself in his
      utterance, and giving full force to the periods of what was generally
      considered a beautiful and silvery voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning, Mr. Bradley,&rsquo; he said, without noticing the other&rsquo;s
      extended hand. &lsquo;You will excuse my rising? The rheumatism in my knees has
      been greatly increased by this wretched weather. Pray take a chair by the
      fire.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley, however, found a seat as far from the fire as possible; for the
      weather was far from cold, and the room itself was like a vapour bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. The Bishop, shading his face with one white hand, on
      which sparkled a valuable diamond ring, was furtively inspecting his
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You sent for me?&rsquo; said Bradley, somewhat awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;about that letter. I cannot tell you how distressed I was when
      I received it; indeed, if I may express myself frankly, I never was so
      shocked in my life. I had always thought you so different, so very
      different. But there! I trust you have come to tell me that the hope I
      expressed was right, and that it was under some temporary aberration that
      you expressed sentiments so extraordinary, so peculiarly perverted, and&mdash;hem!&mdash;unchristian.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman&rsquo;s dark eye flashed, and his brow was knitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely not unchristian,&rsquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not merely that, sir, but positively atheistic!&rsquo; cried the Bishop,
      wheeling round in his chair and looking his visitor full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I expressed myself miserably. I am not an atheist; God forbid!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But as far as I can gather from your expressions, you absolutely dare to
      question the sacred character of the Scriptures, and the Divine nature and
      miraculous life and death of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; replied Bradley, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all!&rsquo; echoed the Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Permit me to explain. I expressed my humble opinion that there are many
      things in the Scriptures which are contradicted by modern evidence, so
      that the sacred writings must be accepted not as history but as poetry;
      and I said that, although the miraculous narrative of Christ&rsquo;s life and
      death might have to be revised, the beautiful Ideal it had set before us
      was sufficient for all our needs. In other words, whether Our Lord was a
      Divine personage or not, He had become a Divine Influence&mdash;which,
      after all, is the same thing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is <i>not</i> the same thing, sir!&rsquo; exclaimed the Bishop, horrified.
      &lsquo;It is very far from being the same thing. Why, any Unitarian would admit
      as much as you do!&mdash;and pardon me for reminding you, you are not a
      Unitarian&mdash;you are a clergyman of the Church of England. You have
      subscribed the Articles&mdash;you&mdash;God bless my soul! what is the
      world coming to, when a Christian minister uses language worthy of the
      atheist Bradlaugh?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remind me that I subscribed the Articles,&rsquo; said Bradley, still
      preserving his calmness. &lsquo;I did so without thought, as so many do, when I
      was a very young man.&rsquo; &lsquo;What are you now, sir? A young man, a very young
      man; and in the audacious spirit of youth and inexperience you touch on
      subjects which the wisest minds of the world have been content to approach
      with reverence, with awe and trembling. I see your position clearly
      enough. The horrible infidelity which fills the air at the present day has
      penetrated your mind, and with the pride of intellectual impiety&mdash;that
      very pride for which Satan was cast from heaven&mdash;you profane the
      mysteries of your religion. After what you have said, I am almost prepared
      to hear you tell me that you actually <i>did</i> write that article on
      Miracles, which your parishioners impute to you, in the &ldquo;Bi-monthly
      Review!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is quite true. I did write that article.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you have contributed to other infidel publications; for instance, to
      the &ldquo;Charing Cross Chronicle,&rdquo; which is edited by an infidel and written
      for infidels?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me; the &ldquo;Chronicle&rdquo; is not generally considered an infidel
      publication.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you contributed to it&mdash;yes or no, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not on religious subjects; on literary topics only.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have written for it; that is enough. All this being granted, I
      think I may safely gather whence you receive your inspirations. From that
      portion of the press which is attempting to destroy our most sacred
      institutions, and which is endeavouring, in one way or another, to
      undermine the whole foundations of the Christian Church.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley rose to his feet and stood on the hearthrug, facing his superior,
      who looked up at him with ill-concealed horror and amazement. By this time
      he was not a little agitated; but he still preserved a certain outward
      composure, and his manner was full of the greatest humility and respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you permit me to explain?&rsquo; he said in a low voice. &lsquo;The hope and
      dream of my life is to upraise the Church, not to destroy it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph! to upraise <i>a</i> church, perhaps, but not the Church of
      Christ.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Church of Christ&mdash;a church wherein all men may worship,
      irrespective of points of dogma, which have been the curse of every
      religion, and of ours most of all. For such a communion only two articles
      of faith would be necessary&mdash;a belief in an all-loving and all-wise
      Creator, or First Unknown Cause, and a belief in a Divine Character,
      created and evolved we need not ask how, but bearing the name of the
      Founder of Christianity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the Bible, sir, the Bible!&rsquo; cried the Bishop, impatiently. &lsquo;What
      would you do with that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would use it in its proper place as&mdash;literature.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Literature!&rsquo; said the Bishop with uplifted hands. &lsquo;You would then class
      that Blessed Book, from which the world has drawn the milk of immortal
      life, in the same category as Homer&rsquo;s Iliad, the profane poems of Horace
      and Catullus, and&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;Lord Byron&rsquo;s poems, and the
      miserable novels of the period?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not quite understand me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, I understand you only too well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not call all printed matter literature; but I hold that all
      literature of the higher kind is, like the Bible, divinely inspired.
      Dante, Milton, and Shakespeare were as assuredly sent by God as Moses and
      Elijah. Shall we call the Book of Job a divine piece of moral teaching,
      and deny that title to &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and &ldquo;King Lear&rdquo;? Is not the &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; of
      Goethe as spiritual a product as the Song of Solomon? Ezekiel was a
      prophet; prophets also are Emerson and Thoreau. Spinoza has been called
      God-intoxicated; and it is true. There might be some question as to the
      mission of Byron (though I myself believe there is none); but surely no
      thinking person can reject the pretensions of that divine poet and
      martyred man who wrote the &ldquo;Prometheus Unbound&rdquo;!&rsquo; &lsquo;Shelley!&rsquo; ejaculated
      the other, as if a bomb had exploded under his feet. &lsquo;Are you actually
      speaking of <i>him</i>, sir?&mdash;the atheist.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was no atheist. More than most men he believed in God&mdash;a god of
      love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much. Quite forgetting his rheumatism, the Bishop threw off
      his rugs and rose tremulously to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bradley,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;let there be an end to this. I have heard you
      patiently and respectfully, thinking perhaps you might have something to
      say in your own defence; but every word you utter is an outrage&mdash;yes,
      sir, an outrage. Such opinions as you have expressed here to-day, and the
      other day in your letter, might be conceivable in a boy fresh from
      college; but coming from one who has been actually ordained, and has held
      more than one office in the Church, they savour of blasphemy. In any case,
      I shall have to take the matter into consideration, with a view to your
      immediate suspension. But if you wish it I will give you time&mdash;a
      little time&mdash;to reflect. I would do anything to avoid a scandal.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman lifted his hat and stick, with a slight involuntary shrug of
      the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, then, as I expected,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I am to be denounced and
      unfrocked. The days of persecution are not yet quite over, I perceive.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop flushed angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is absurd to talk of persecution in such a case, Mr. Bradley. Do you
      yourself conceive it possible that you, bearing such opinions, can remain
      in the Church?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not conceive it possible. Shall I resign at once?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Permit me to think it over, and perhaps to consult with those who in such
      matters are wiser than myself. I shall do nothing hasty, or harsher than
      the occasion warrants, be sure of that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; returned Bradley, with a peculiar smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall hear from me. In the meantime, let me entreat you to be
      careful. Good morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a cold bow the Bishop dismissed his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the episcopal residence Bradley went straight to the railway
      station, had a slight and hasty lunch at the buffet, and then took the
      midday express to London. Entering a second-class carriage, the only other
      occupants of which were a burly personage going up for a Cattle Show and a
      spruce individual with &lsquo;bagman&rsquo; written on every lineament of his
      countenance, he resigned himself to reflections on his peculiar position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout these reflections I have no intention of following him, but
      they seemed less gloomy and miserable than might be conceived possible
      under the circumstances. His eye was clear and determined, his mouth set
      firmly, and now and then he smiled sadly to himself&mdash;just as he had
      smiled in the presence of the Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The express reached London in about six hours, so that it was evening when
      Bradley arrived at King&rsquo;s Cross, carrying with him only a small hand-bag.
      Instead of hailing a cab, he walked right on along the streets&mdash;through
      Taviton Street to Russell Square, thence into Holborn, and thence, across
      Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, into the Strand. He then turned off towards the
      Temple, which he entered with the air of one who knew its quiet recesses
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was turning into Pump Court when he suddenly came face to face with a
      man of about thirty, elegantly dressed, with faultless gloves and boots,
      and carrying a light cane. He was very fresh and fair-complexioned, with
      sandy whiskers and moustaches; and to complete his rather dandified
      appearance he sported an eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cholmondeley!&rsquo; cried the clergyman, pronouncing it &lsquo;Chumley&rsquo; according to
      the approven mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ambrose Bradley!&rsquo; returned the other. &lsquo;Is it possible? Why, I thought you
      were hundreds of miles away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came up here by the express, and was just coming to see you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then come along with me and dine at the &ldquo;Reform.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked a strange contrast as they walked on side by side&mdash;the
      powerful, gravelooking man, shabbily attired in his semiclerical dress,
      and the elegant exquisite attired in the height of London fashion, with
      his mild blue eye and his eyeglass in position. Yet John Cholmondeley was
      something more than the mere ornamental young person he appeared; and as
      for his mildness, who that had read his savage articles on foreign
      politics in the &lsquo;Bi-monthly Review&rsquo; would have taken him for a harmless
      person? He was a Positivist of Positivists, an M.A. of Oxford, and the
      acting-editor of the &lsquo;Charing Cross Chronicle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His literary style was hysterical and almost feminine in its ferocity.
      Personally he was an elegant young man, with a taste for good wines and
      good cigars, and a tendency in external matters to follow the prevailing
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove to the &lsquo;Reform&rsquo; in a hansom, and dined together. At the table
      adjoining theirs on one side two Cabinet Ministers were seated in company
      with Jack Bustle, of the &lsquo;Chimes,&rsquo; and Sir Topaz Cromwell, the young
      general just returned from South Africa; at the table on the other side an
      Under-Secretary of State was giving a little feast to Joseph Moody, the
      miners&rsquo; agent and delegate, who had been a miner himself, and who was just
      then making some stir in political circles by his propaganda.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they adjourned to the smoking-room, which they found almost
      empty; and then, in a few eager sentences, Bradley explained his position
      and solicited his friend&rsquo;s advice. For that advice was well worth having,
      Cholmondeley being not only a clever thinker but a shrewd man of the
      world.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> am not at all
      surprised at what you have told me,&rsquo; said Cholmondeley, sipping his coffee
      and smoking his cigar. &lsquo;I knew that it <i>must</i> come sooner or later.
      Your position in the Church has always been an anomalous one, and, egad!
      if you have been going on as you tell me, I don&rsquo;t wonder they want to get
      rid of you. Well, what do you intend to do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is just the point I came to consult you upon,&rsquo; returned the
      clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what I should do in your place. I should stand to my colours, and
      give them a last broadside. The &lsquo;Chronicle&rsquo; is open to you, you know. The
      old ship of the Church is no longer seaworthy, and if you helped to sink
      it you would be doing a service to humanity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God forbid!&rsquo; cried Bradley, fervently. &lsquo;I would rather cut off my right
      hand than do anything to injure the Establishment. After all, it is the
      only refuge in times of doubt and fear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It strikes me you are rather inconsistent,&rsquo; said Cholmondeley with cool
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all. It is precisely because I love the Church, because I believe
      in its spiritual mission, that I would wish to see it reorganised on a
      scientific and rational basis. When all is said and done, I am a Christian&mdash;that
      is, a believer in the Divine Idea of self-sacrifice and the enthusiasm of
      humanity. All that is beautiful and holy, all that may redeem man and lead
      him to an everlasting righteousness, is, in my opinion, summed up in the
      one word, Christianity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear Bradley, you have rejected the <i>thing!</i> Why not
      dispense with the <i>name</i> as well?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe the name to be indispensable. I believe, moreover, that the
      world would waste away of its own carnality and atheism without a
      Christian priesthood. In the flesh or in the spirit Christ lives, to
      redeem the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since you believe so much,&rsquo; said Cholmondrley drily, &lsquo;it is a pity you
      don&rsquo;t believe a little more. For my own part, you know my opinion&mdash;which
      is, that Christ gets a great deal more credit for what is good in
      civilisation than He deserves. Science has done more in one hundred years
      to redeem the race than Christianity has done in eighteen hundred. <i>Verb,
      sap</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Science is one of his handmaids,&rsquo; returned Bradley, &lsquo;and Art is another;
      that is why I would admit both of these into the service of the Temple.
      But bereft of his influence, separated from the Divine Idea, and oblivious
      of the Divine Character, both Science and Art go stumbling in the dark&mdash;and
      blaspheme. When Science gives the lie to any deathless human instinct&mdash;when,
      for example, she negatives the dream of personal immortality&mdash;she
      simply stultifies herself; for she knows nothing and can tell us nothing
      on that subject, whereas Christ, answering the impulse of the human heart,
      tells us <i>all</i>. When Art says that she labours for her own sake, and
      that the mere reproduction of beautiful earthly forms is soul-satisfying,
      she also is stultified; for there is no true art apart from the religious
      spirit. In one word, Science and Art, rightly read, are an integral part
      of the world&rsquo;s religion, which is Christianity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I confess I don&rsquo;t follow you,&rsquo; said the journalist, laughing; &lsquo;but there,
      you were always a dreamer. Frankly, I think this bolstering up of an old
      creed with the truths of the new is a little dishonest. Christianity is
      based upon certain miraculous events, which have been proved to be untrue;
      man&rsquo;s foolish belief in their truth has led to an unlimited amount of
      misery; and having disposed of your creed&rsquo;s miraculous pretensions&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you quite sure you have disposed of them?&rsquo; interrupted Bradley. &lsquo;In
      any case, is not the personal and posthumous influence of Our Saviour, as
      seen in the world&rsquo;s history, quite as miraculous as any of the events
      recorded of Him during His lifetime?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary! But upon my life, Bradley, I don&rsquo;t know where to have
      you! You seem to have taken a brief on both sides. Beware of indecision&mdash;it
      won&rsquo;t do in religion. You are stumbling between two stools.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I say with Mercutio, &ldquo;a plague on both your houses!&rdquo;&rsquo; cried Bradley,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you see I want to reconcile them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t do it. It&rsquo;s too old a feud&mdash;a vendetta, in fact. Remember
      what Mercutio himself got by trying to be a peacemaker. The world can
      understand your Tybalts and your Parises&mdash;that is to say, your
      fire-eating Voltaires and your determined Tom Paines&mdash;but it
      distrusts the men who, like Matt Arnold <i>et hoc genus omne</i>, believe
      simply nothing, and yet try to whitewash the old idols.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. The two men looked at each other in friendly
      antagonism, Cholmondeley puffing his cigar leisurely with the air of a man
      who had solved the great problem, and Bradley smoking with a certain
      suppressed excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the clergyman spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think we shall agree&mdash;so let us cease to argue. What I want
      you to understand is, that I do love the Church, and cannot part from her
      without deep pain&mdash;without, in fact, rupturing all my most cherished
      associations. But there is another complication which makes this affair
      unusually distressing to me. You know I am engaged to be married?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, yes! I heard something about it. I begin to see your difficulty. You
      are afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, as if not liking to complete the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Afraid of what, pray?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that, when you are pronounced heretical, she will throw you over!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman smiled curiously and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that were all,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;I should be able very easily to resign
      myself to the consequences of my heresy; but, fortunately or
      unfortunately, the lady to whom I am engaged (our engagement, by the way,
      is only private) is not likely to throw me over, however much I may seem
      to deserve it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why distress yourself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Simply because I doubt my right to entail upon her the consequences of my
      heterodoxy. She herself is liberal-minded, but she does not perceive that
      any connection with a heretic must mean, for a sensitive woman, misery and
      martyrdom. When I leave the Church I shall be practically ruined&mdash;not
      exactly in pocket, for, as you know, I have some money of my own&mdash;but
      intellectually and socially. The Church never pardons, and seldom spares.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there are other careers open to you&mdash;literature, for example! We
      all know your talents&mdash;you would soon win an eminence from which you
      might laugh at your persecutors.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Literature, my dear Cholmondeley, is simply empiricism&mdash;I see
      nothing in it to attract an earnest man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are complimentary!&rsquo; cried Cholmondeley, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&mdash;you are different! You carry into journalism an amount of
      secular conviction which I could never emulate; and, moreover, you are one
      of those who, like Harry the Smith, always fight &ldquo;for your own hand.&rdquo; Now,
      I do not fight for my own hand; I repeat emphatically, all my care is for
      the Church. She may persecute me, she may despise me, but still I love her
      and believe in her, and shall pray till my last breath for the time when
      she will become reorganised.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see how all this will end,&rsquo; said the journalist, half seriously. &lsquo;Some
      of these days you will go over to Rome!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think so? Well, I might do worse even than <i>that</i>, for in
      Rome, now as ever, I should find excellent company. But no, I don&rsquo;t fancy
      that I shall go even halfway thither, unless&mdash;which is scarcely
      possible&mdash;I discover signs that the doting mother of Christianity
      accepts the new scientific miracle and puts Darwin out of the <i>Index</i>.
      Frankly, my difficulty is a social, or rather a personal, one. Ought I, a
      social outcast, to accept the devotion of one who would follow me, not
      merely out of the Church, but down into the very Hell of atheism, if I
      gave her the requisite encouragement?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley did not reply, but after reflecting quietly for some moments
      he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not told me the name of the lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Alma Craik.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Not</i> the heiress?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the heiress.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know her cousin, George Craik&mdash;we were at school together. I
      thought they were engaged.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They were once, but she broke it off long ago.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And she has accepted <i>you</i>?&rsquo; &lsquo;Unconditionally.&rsquo; He added with
      strange fervour: &lsquo;She is the noblest, the sweetest, and most beautiful
      woman in the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why on earth do you hesitate?&rsquo; asked Cholmondeley. &lsquo;You are a lucky
      fellow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hesitate for the reason I have told you. She had placed her love, her
      life, her fortune at my feet, devotedly and unreservedly. As a clergyman
      of the Church, as one who might have devoted his lifetime to the
      re-establishment of his religion and the regeneration of his order, one,
      moreover, whom the world would have honoured and approved as a good and
      faithful servant, I might have accepted the sacrifice; indeed, after some
      hesitation, I did accept it. But now it is altogether different. I cannot
      consent to her martyrdom, even though it would glorify mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Bradley exercised the strongest control over his emotions, and
      endeavoured to discuss the subject as dispassionately and calmly as
      possible, it was clear to his listener that he was deeply and strangely
      moved. Cholmondeley was touched, for he well knew the secret tenderness of
      his friend&rsquo;s nature. Under that coldly cut, almost stern face, with its
      firm eyebrows and finely chiselled lips&mdash;within that powerful frame
      which, so far at least as the torso was concerned, might have been used as
      a model for Hercules&mdash;there throbbed a heart of almost feminine
      sensitiveness and sweetness; of feminine passion too, if the truth must be
      told, for Bradley possessed the sensuousness of most powerful men. Bradley
      was turned thirty years of age, but he was as capable of a <i>grande
      passion</i> as a boy of twenty&mdash;as romantic, as high-flown, as full
      of the fervour of youth and the brightness of dream. With him, to love a
      woman was to love her with all his faith and all his life; he was far too
      earnest to trifle for a moment with the most sacred of all human
      sentiments. Cholmondeley was aware of this, and gauged the situation
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If my advice is worth anything,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you will dismiss from your
      mind all ideas of martyrdom. You are really exaggerating the horrors of
      the situation; and, for the rest, where a woman loves a man as I am sure
      Miss Craik loves you, sacrifice of the kind you mention becomes easy, even
      delightful. Marry her, my dear Bradley, and from the very altar of pagan
      Hymen smile at the thunderbolts of the Church.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley seemed plunged in deep thought, and sat silent, leaning back and
      covering his face with one hand. At last he looked up, and exclaimed with
      unconcealed emotion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I am not worthy of her! Even if my present record were clean, what
      could I say of my past? Such a woman should have a stainless husband! I
      have touched pitch, and been defiled.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come!&rsquo; said the journalist, not a little astonished. &lsquo;Of all the
      men I ever knew&mdash;and I have known many&mdash;you are about the most
      irreproachable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman bent over the table, and said in a low voice, &lsquo;Do you
      remember Mary Goodwin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; replied the other with a laugh. &lsquo;What! is it possible that
      you are reproaching yourself on <i>that</i> account? Absurd! You acted by
      her like a man of honour; but little Mary was too knowing for you, that
      was all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You knew I married her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suspected it, knowing your high-flown notions of duty. We all pitied
      you&mdash;we all&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said the clergyman, still in the same low, agitated voice. &lsquo;Not a
      word against her. She is asleep and at peace; and if there was any sin I
      shared it&mdash;I who ought to have known better. Perhaps, had I been a
      better man, I might have made her truly happy; but she didn&rsquo;t love me&mdash;I
      did not deserve her love&mdash;and so, as you know, we parted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know she used you shamefully,&rsquo; returned Cholmondeley, with some
      impatience. &lsquo;Come, I <i>must</i> speak! You picked her from the gutter,
      and made her what Mrs. Grundy calls an honest woman. How did she reward
      you? By bolting away with the first rascal who offered her the run of his
      purse and a flash set of diamonds. By-the-by, I heard of her last in
      India, where she was a member of a strolling company. Did she die out
      there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered the clergyman, very sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nine years ago.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were only a boy,&rsquo; continued Cholmondeley, with an air of infinite age
      and experience, &lsquo;and Mr. Verdant Green was nothing to you. You thought all
      women angels, at an age when most youngsters know them to be devils. Well,
      that&rsquo;s all over, and you have nothing to reproach yourself with. I wish <i>I</i>
      could show as clean a book, old fellow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do reproach myself, nevertheless,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;That boyish episode
      has left its taint on my whole life; yes, it is like the mark of a brand
      burned into the very flesh. I had no right to woo another woman; yet I
      have done so, to my shame, and now Heaven is about to punish me by
      stripping me bare in her sight and making me a social outlaw. I have
      deserved it all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two remained together for some time longer, but Bradley, though he
      listened gently to his friends remonstrances, could not be persuaded to
      take a less gloomy view of the situation. He was relieved unconsciously,
      nevertheless, by the other&rsquo;s cheery and worldly counsel. It was something,
      at least, to have eased his heart, to have poured the secret of his sorrow
      and fear into a sympathetic bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had dined very early, and when they rose to separate it was only
      half-past eight o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you go on to my chambers?&rsquo; asked Cholmondeley. &lsquo;I can give you a
      bed, and I will join you after I have done my duties at the office.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I shall sleep at Morley&rsquo;s Hotel, and take the early morning express
      down home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They strolled together along Pall Mall and across Leicester Square, where
      they separated, Cholmondeley sauntering airily, with that sense of
      superhuman insight which sits so lightly on the daily journalist, towards
      the newspaper office in Cumberland Street, and the clergyman turning into
      Morley&rsquo;s, where he was well known, to arrange for his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was still so early, however, Bradley did not stay in the hotel, but
      lighted his pipe and strolled thoughtfully along the busy Strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a little after nine o&rsquo;clock he found himself close to the Parthenon
      Theatre, where &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; was then being performed for over the hundredth
      night. He had always been a lover of the theatre, and he now remembered
      that Mr. Aram&rsquo;s performance of the Danish prince was the talk of London.
      Glad to discover any means of distracting his dreary thoughts, he paid his
      two shillings, and found a place at the back of the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third act was just beginning as he entered, and it was not until its
      conclusion that he began to look around the crowded house. The assemblage
      was a fashionable one, and every box as well as every stall was occupied.
      Many of the intelligent spectators held in their hands books of the play,
      with which they might be supposed to be acquainting themselves for the
      first time; and all wore upon their faces more or less of that bored
      expression characteristic of audiences which take their pleasures sadly,
      not to say stupidly. In all the broad earth there is nothing which can
      quite equal the sedate unintelligence of an English theatrical audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as he gazed, his eyes became attracted by a face in one of the
      private boxes&mdash;he started, went pale, and looked again&mdash;as he
      did so, the head was turned away towards the back of the box. Trembling
      like one that had seen an apparition, he waited for it to incline again
      his way&mdash;and when it did so he watched it in positive horror. As if
      to convince himself of its identity, he borrowed an opera-glass from a
      respectable-looking man seated near him, and fixed it on the face in the
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of a woman, splendidly attired, with diamonds sparkling on her
      naked throat and arms, and other diamonds in her hair. The hair was
      jet-black, and worn very low down on the forehead, almost reaching to the
      thick black eyebrows, beneath which shone a pair of eyes as black and bold
      as those of Circe herself. Her complexion had the olive clearness of a
      perfect brunette, and her mouth, which was ripe and full, was crimson red
      as some poisonous flower&mdash;not with blood, but paint. She was
      certainly very handsome, though somewhat <i>petite</i> and over-plump. Her
      only visible companion was a plainly dressed elderly woman, with whom she
      seldom exchanged a word, and a little boy of seven, elegantly dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley looked again and again, and the more he looked the more his wonder
      and horror grew. During all the rest of the performance he scarcely
      withdrew his eyes, but just before the curtain fell he slipped out of the
      pit, and passed round to the portico in front of the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he waited, in the shadow of one of the pillars, till the throng
      began to flow forth, and the linkmen began summoning the carriages and
      cabs to take up their elegant burthens. The vestibule of the theatre was
      full of gentlemen in full dress and ladies in opera-cloaks, laughing and
      chatting over the evening&rsquo;s performance. He drew close to the glass doors
      and looked in, pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he saw the lady he sought, standing with the woman and the child,
      and talking gaily with an elderly gentleman who sported an eyeglass. How
      bold and beautiful she looked! He watched her in fascination, always
      taking care to keep out of the range of her vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she shook hands with the gentleman, and moved towards the door. He
      drew back into the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood on the threshold, looking out into the night, and the linkman
      ran up to her, touching his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Montmorency&rsquo;s carriage,&rsquo; she said in a clear silvery voice; and the
      man ran off to seek the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a smart brougham came up, and, accompanied by her elderly
      companion and the child, she stepped in. Almost simultaneously, Bradley
      crossed the pavement and leapt into a hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep that carriage in view,&rsquo; he said to the driver, pointing to the
      brougham, &lsquo;and I will give you a sovereign.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed and nodded, and immediately the pursuit began.

      CHAPTER V.&mdash;&lsquo;MRS. MONTMORENCY.&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ay me, I sowed a seed in youth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Nor knew that &rsquo;twas a dragon&rsquo;s tooth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      Legions of woe without a name.&mdash;<i>Fausticulus.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he brougham passed
      rapidly up Wellington Street into Long Acre, thence into Oxford Street,
      passing westward till it came to Regent Circus, then it was driven up
      Portland Place to the gates of Regent&rsquo;s Park. It entered, and the hansom
      followed about fifty yards behind. Passing to the left around the park, it
      reached Cranwell Terrace, and drew up before one of the large houses
      fronting the artificial water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hansom paused too, but Bradley kept his seat until he saw the lady and
      her companion alight, knock at the door, and enter in; while the brougham
      drove round to the stables at the rear. Then he sprang out, paid the man
      his sovereign, and prepared to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he hesitated on the steps of the house, as if undecided
      whether to knock or fly; but recovering his determination he knocked
      loudly. The sound had scarcely died away when the door was opened by the
      same elderly woman he had noticed at the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Montmorency?&rsquo; he said, for he had got the name by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at him in surprise, and answered with a strong French
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame has only just come in, and you cannot see her to-night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>must</i> see her,&rsquo; returned the clergyman, entering the hall. &lsquo;It is
      a matter of very important business.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is so late. To-morrow, monsieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow I am leaving London. I must see her at once.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing his persistence, and observing that he had the manners of a
      gentleman, the woman yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will step this way, I will tell madame, but I am afraid she will
      not see you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying she led the way into a room on the ground floor, furnished
      splendidly as a kind of study, and communicating with a small dining room,
      which in its turn led to a large conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your name, monsieur, if you please?&rsquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is of no consequence&mdash;perhaps your mistress would not
      remember it. Tell her simply that a gentleman wishes to see her on very
      important business.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With another look of wonder, the woman withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still dreadfully pale and agitated, Bradley surveyed the apartment. It was
      furnished oddly, but with a perfect disregard of expense. A gorgeous
      Turkey carpet covered the floor; the curtains were of black-and-gold
      tapestry, the chairs of gold and crimson. In a recess, close to the
      window, was an elegant ormolu writing-desk, surmounted by a small marble
      statue, representing a young maid just emerging from the bath. Copies of
      well-known pictures covered the walls, but one picture was a genuine Etty,
      representing Diana and her virgins surprised by Actæon. Over the
      mantelpiece, which was strewn with golden and silver ornaments, and
      several photographs in frames, was a copy of Titian&rsquo;s Venus, very
      admirably coloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the inexperienced mind of the clergyman, ill acquainted with a certain
      phase of society, the pictures seemed sinister, almost diabolic. The room,
      moreover, was full of a certain sickly scent like <i>patchouli</i>, as if
      some perfumed creature had just passed through it leaving the scent
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew near the mantelpiece and looked at the photographs. Several of
      them he failed to recognise, though they represented women well known in
      the theatrical world; but in one he recognised the elderly gentleman with
      the eyeglass whom he had seen at the theatre, in another the little boy,
      and in two the mistress of the house herself. In one of the two last she
      was represented semi-nude, in the spangled trunks, flesh-coloured tights,
      and high-heeled boots of some fairy prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gazing at this photograph in horror, when he heard the rustle of a
      dress behind him. Turning quickly, he found himself face to face with the
      woman he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment their eyes met, she uttered a sharp cry and went even more pale
      than usual, if that were possible. As she recoiled before him, he thought
      she did so in fear, but he was mistaken. All she did was to move to the
      door, peep out into the lobby, then, closing the door rapidly, she faced
      him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression of her face was curious to behold. It was a strange mixture
      of devilry and effrontery. She wore the dress she had worn in the theatre&mdash;her
      arms, neck, and bosom were still naked and covered with diamonds; and her
      eyes flashed with a beautiful but forbidding light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is <i>you!</i>&rsquo; she said in a low voice. &lsquo;At last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood before her like a man of marble, livid, ghastly, unable to speak,
      but surveying her with eyes of infinite despair. The sickly scent he had
      noticed in the room clung about her, and filled the air he was breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. At last, unable any longer to bear his steadfast
      gaze, she laughed sharply, and, tripping across the room, threw herself in
      a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; she said, looking up at him with a wicked smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      His predominant thought then found a broken utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is true, then!&mdash;and I believed you <i>dead!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; she answered, showing her white teeth maliciously, &lsquo;and you
      are doubtless very sorry to find yourself mistaken. No, I am very much
      alive, as you see. I would gladly have died to oblige you, but it was
      impossible, <i>mon cher</i>. But won&rsquo;t you take a seat? We can talk as
      well sitting as standing, and I am very tired.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost involuntarily, he obeyed her, and taking a chair sat down, still
      with his wild eyes fixed upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My God!&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;And you are still the same, after all these
      years.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leant back in her chair, surveying him critically. It was obvious that
      her light manner concealed a certain dread of him; for her bare bosom rose
      and fell quickly, and her breath came in short sharp pants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, my dear Ambrose, are not much changed&mdash;a little older, of
      course, for you were only a foolish boy then, but still very much the
      same. I suppose, by your clerical necktie, that you have gone into the
      Church? Have you got on well? I am sure I hope so, with all my heart; and
      I always said you were cut out for that kind of life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to her like one listening to some evil spirit in a dream. It
      was difficult for him to believe the evidence of his own senses. He had
      been so certain that the woman was dead and buried past recall!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you find me out?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw you at the theatre, and followed you home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Eh bien!</i>&rsquo; she exclaimed, with a very doubtful French
      pronunciation. &lsquo;What do you want with me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Want with you?&rsquo; he repeated. &lsquo;My God! Nothing!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again, flashing her teeth and eyes. Then springing up, she
      approached a small table, and took up a large box of cigarettes. Her white
      hand trembled violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I offer you a cigarette?&rsquo; she said, glancing at him over her naked
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With your permission I will light one myself!&rsquo; she said, striking a wax
      match and suiting the action to the word. Then holding the cigarette
      daintily between her white teeth, she again sat down facing him. &lsquo;Well, I
      am glad you have not come to make a scene. It is too late for that. We
      agreed to part long ago, and it was all for the best.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>left</i> me,&rsquo; he answered in a hollow voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; she replied, watching the thin cloud of smoke as it wreathed
      from her lips. &lsquo;I left you because I saw we could never get along
      together. It was a stupid thing of us to marry, but it would have been a
      still stupider thing to remain tied together like two galley-slaves. I was
      not the little innocent fool you supposed me, and you were not the swell I
      at first imagined; so we were both taken in. I went to India with young
      St. Clare, and after he left me I was very ill, and a report, which I did
      not contradict, got into the papers that I had died. I went on the stage
      out there under an assumed name, and some years ago returned to England.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; he asked with more decision than he had yet shown, &lsquo;how are you
      living?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you want to know?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and stood frowning over her, and despite her assumed <i>sang-froid</i>
      she looked a little alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, when all is said and done, I am your <i>husband!</i> Whatever
      you now call yourself, you are the same Mary Goodwin whom I married at
      Oxford ten years ago, and the tie which links us together has never been
      legally broken. Yet I find you here, living in luxury, and I suppose in
      infamy. Who pays for it all? Who is your present victim?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With an impatient gesture and a flash of her white teeth she threw her
      cigarette into the fire, and rose up before him trembling, with fear, or
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you have found your tongue at last!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Do you think I am
      afraid of you? No, I defy you! This is my house, and if you are not civil
      I will have you turned out of it. Bah! it is like you to come threatening
      me, at the eleventh hour.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her petulant rage did not deceive him; it was only a mask hastily assumed
      to conceal her growing alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer my question, Mary!&mdash;how are you living?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down quietly, and I will tell you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed her, covering his eyes with his hand. She watched him for a
      moment; then, reassured by his subdued manner, she proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not sure that I ought to tell you, but I dare say you would find
      out. Lord Ombermere&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord Ombermere!&rsquo; echoed the clergyman. &lsquo;Why, to my knowledge, he has a
      wife&mdash;and children.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her white shoulders, with a little grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is his affair, not mine,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;For the rest, I know the fact,
      and never trouble myself about it. He is very good to me, and awfully
      rich. I have all I want. He sent me to France and had me taught French and
      music; and he has settled a competence upon our boy. That is how the
      matter stands. I do pretty much as I like, but if Eustace knew I had a
      husband actually living he would make a scene, and perhaps we should have
      to part.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible?&mdash;and&mdash;and are you happy?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly,&rsquo; was the cool reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley paced up and down the chamber in agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such a life is an infamy,&rsquo; he at last exclaimed. &lsquo;It is an offence
      against man and God.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know all that cant, and I suppose you speak as a clergyman; but I do my
      duty by the man who keeps me, and never&mdash;like some I could name&mdash;have
      intrigues with other men. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair, and it wouldn&rsquo;t pay. I
      hope,&rsquo; she added, as if struck suddenly by the thought, &lsquo;you have not come
      here to-night imagining I shall return to <i>you?</i>&rsquo; He recoiled as if
      from a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Return to me? God forbid!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So say <i>I</i>, though you might put it a little more politely. By the
      way, I forgot to ask you,&mdash;but perhaps you yourself have married
      again?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The question came suddenly like a stab. Bradley started in fresh horror,
      holding his hand upon his heart. She exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might have done so, you know, thinking me food for worms, and if such
      were the case you may be sure I should never have betrayed you. No; &ldquo;live
      and let live&rdquo; is my motto. I am not such a fool as to suppose you have
      never looked at another woman; and if you had consoled yourself, taking
      some nice, pretty, quiet, homely creature, fit to be a clergyman&rsquo;s wife,
      to mend his stockings, and to visit the sick with rolls of flannel and
      bottles of beef-tea, I should have thought you had acted like a sensible
      man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too horrible. He felt stifled, asphyxiated. He had never before
      encountered such a woman, though their name is legion in all the Babylons,
      and he could not understand her. With a deep frown he rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going?&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t, till we understand each other!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and fixed his eyes despairingly upon her, looking so worn, so
      miserable, that even her hard heart was touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try to think I am really dead,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and it will be all right. I
      have changed both my life and my name, and no one of my old friends knows
      me. I don&rsquo;t act. Eustace wanted to take a theatre for me, but, after all,
      I prefer idleness to work, and I am not likely to reappear. I have no
      acquaintances out of theatrical circles, where I am known only as Mrs.
      Montmorency. So you see there is no danger, <i>mon cher</i>. Let me alone,
      and I shall let you alone. You can marry again whenever you like.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she touched that cruel chord, and again he seemed like a man
      stabbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marry?&rsquo; he echoed. &lsquo;But I am not free! You are still my wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I deny it,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;We are divorced; I divorced myself. It is
      just the same as if we had gone before the judge: a course you will surely
      never adopt, for it would disgrace you terribly and ruin <i>me</i>,
      perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eustace is horribly proud, and if it should all come out about his keeping
      me, he would never forgive me. No, no, you&rsquo;ll never be such a fool!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she watched him eagerly, as if anxious for some assurance that he
      would not draw her into the open daylight of a legal prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her, as if following her own wild thoughts&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I spare you? Why should I drag on my lifetime, tied by the law
      to a shameless woman? Why should I keep your secret and countenance your
      infamy? Do you take me for one of those men who have no souls, no
      consciences, no honour? Do you think that I will bear the horror of a
      guilty secret, now I know that you live, and that God has not been
      merciful enough to rid me of such a curse?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time he had seemed really violent. In his pain he almost
      touched her with his clenched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better not strike me!&rsquo; she said viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door opened, and a little boy (the same Bradley had
      seen at the theatre) ran eagerly in. He was dressed in a suit of black
      velvet, with bows of coloured ribbon, and, though he was pale and
      evidently delicate, he looked charmingly innocent and pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Maman! maman!</i>&rsquo; he cried in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned angrily, answering him in the same tongue&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Que cherchez-vous, Bébé? Allez-vous en!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Maman, je viens vous souhaiter la bonne nuit!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Allez, allez</i>,&rsquo; she replied impatiently, &lsquo;<i>je viendrai vous
      baiser quand vous serez couché</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wondering look at the stranger the child ran from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interruption seemed to have calmed them both. There was a brief
      silence, during which Bradley gazed drearily at the door through which the
      child had vanished, and his companion seemed lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time has perhaps come to explain that, if this worldly and sin-stained
      woman had one redeeming virtue, it was love for her little boy. True, she
      showed it strangely, being subject to curious aberrations of mood. The
      child was secretly afraid of her. Sometimes she would turn upon him, for
      some trivial fault, with violent passion; the next moment she would cover
      him with kisses and load him with toys. In her heart she adored him;
      indeed, he was the only thing in the world that she felt to be her own.
      She knew how terribly his birth, when he grew up, would tell against his
      chances in life, and she had so managed matters that Lord Ombermere had
      settled a large sum of money unconditionally upon the child; which money
      was already invested for him, in his mother&rsquo;s name, in substantial
      Government securities. Her own relation with Ombermere, I may remark in
      passing, was a curious one. Whenever he was in London, his lordship
      dropped in every afternoon at about four, as &lsquo;Mr. Montmorency&rsquo;; he took a
      cup of tea in company with mother and child; at a quarter to six precisely
      he looked at his watch and rose to go; and at seven he was dining in
      Bentinck Square, surrounded by his legal children, and faced by his lady.
      Personally, he was a mild, pale man, without intelligence or
      conversational powers of any kind, and &lsquo;Mrs. Montmorency&rsquo; found his
      company exceedingly tedious and tame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see my position,&rsquo; said Mrs. Montmorency at last. &lsquo;If you have no
      consideration for me, perhaps you will have some for my boy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman sighed, and looked at her as if dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must think it over,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;All this has come as a terrible shock
      upon me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I see you again?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God knows!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you should call, never do so between four and six; those are Eustace&rsquo;s
      hours. I am generally in during the evening, unless I go to the theatre.
      Good night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with the ghost of a smile she extended her hand. He took it vacantly,
      and held it limply for a moment. Then he dropped it with another sigh, and
      went to the door, which he opened. Turning on the threshold, he saw her
      standing in the centre of the room, pale, beautiful, and baleful. She
      smiled again, flashing her eyes and showing her white teeth. With a
      shudder that went through all his frame, he passed out into the silent
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now very late, and the Park lay still and sleeping under the dim
      light of the moon. From time to time a carriage passed by, but the
      pavement was quite deserted. Full of what he had seen, with the eyes of
      his soul turned inward to the horrible reflection, he wandered slowly
      along, his footfalls sounding hollow and ominous on the footpath, as he
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively, but almost unreflectingly, he took the direction of his
      hotel; passed out of the park and into Harley Street, thence across
      Cavendish Square to Regent Circus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed now to him as if his fate was sealed. God, in indignation at his
      revolt, meant to deal him full measure. Attacked on one side by the
      thunders of the Church, and tormented on the other by the ghost of his own
      youthful folly, where was he to find firm foothold for his feet? His one
      comfort in the strenuousness of his intellectual strife had been the
      sympathy and devotion of a woman who was now surely lost to him for ever;
      a woman who, compared to this frightful apparition of a dead past, was a
      very spirit of heaven. Yes, he loved an angel&mdash;an angel who would
      have redeemed him; and lo! in the very hour of his hope, his life was to
      be possessed by an incarnate devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts travelled back to the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of the time when he had first known Mary Goodwin. He was a
      youth at Oxford, and she was the daughter of a small tradesman. She was
      very pretty and modest-looking in those days; though she knew the world
      well, and the worst side of it, she seemed to know it very little. His
      boy&rsquo;s heart went out to her beauty, and he became entangled in an amour
      which he thought a seduction; she played her part prettily, with no lack
      of tears, so that, although he already knew that his first wild fancy was
      not love, he married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards his eyes were opened. The tender looking, mild-spoken,
      black-eyed little beauty showed that she had been only acting a part. As
      their marriage was a secret one, and they could not live together, she
      resided in the town, and was left a good deal to herself. Once or twice
      whispers came to his ears that he did not like, and he remonstrated with
      her; she answered violently, in such terms as opened his eyes still wider
      to her character. She was exorbitant in her demands for money, and she
      dressed gorgeously, in execrable taste. When his supplies fell short, as
      was inevitable, she was still well provided; and he accepted her statement
      that the supplementary sums came from her father. Once, coming upon her
      one evening unexpectedly, he found her hysterical and much the worse for
      liquor: empty champagne bottles and glasses were lying on the table, and
      the room was full of the scent of tobacco smoke. He discovered that two
      men of his own college had been calling upon her. A scene ensued, which
      was only one of many. I have no intention, however, of going into all the
      wretched details of what is a very common story; but it is sufficient to
      say that Bradley discovered himself tied miserably to a creature without
      honour, without education, without virtue, sometimes without decency.
      Nevertheless he did not cast her out or expose her, but during the
      Vacation took her with him to London, trying hard to reclaim her. It was
      while they were stopping there that she relieved him of all further
      suspense by walking off one day with all his ready cash, and joining an
      officer whose acquaintance she had made by accident in the open street.
      Bradley searched for her everywhere without success. It was not for many
      weeks afterwards that he received a line from her, addressed from
      Gibraltar, telling him that she was <i>en route</i> for India, and that
      she had no wish either to see him or to hear from him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she disappeared from his life, and when the report of her death reached
      him he was touched, but secretly relieved. Few even of his own personal
      friends knew much of this chapter of his experience: he had been wise
      enough to keep his actual marriage to the woman as dark as possible. So he
      entered the Church a free man, and purer than most men in having only one
      unfortunate record, throughout which he had acted honourably, on his
      conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, after all those years, she had arisen from the grave! At the very
      moment when he was most threatened with other perils, of body and of soul,
      and when his place in the world of work and duty was most insecure, she
      had appeared, to drive him to despair! He had been so certain that she had
      passed away, with all her sins, that she had become in time almost a sad
      sweet memory, of one more sinned against than sinning. And all the time
      she had been roaming up and down the earth, painted and dissolute, cruel
      and predatory&mdash;no longer a reckless girl, but a cold, calculating
      woman, with all the audacity of her experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was worse, he thought; she, in her splendour of wealth and mature
      beauty, was infinitely fouler. How calmly she wore her infamy! how lightly
      she trafficked with him for his silence, for his complicity! Unconscious
      of her own monstrosity, she dared to bargain with <i>him</i>&mdash;her
      husband&mdash;a priest of Christ!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let those who sympathise with Bradley in his despair beware of sharing his
      revengeful thoughts. In simple fact, the woman was rising, not falling;
      her life, bad as it was from certain points of view, was still a certain
      advance upon what it once had been&mdash;was certainly a purer and an
      honester life than that of many men; than that, for example, of the
      honoured member of the aristocracy who paid her bills. She was faithful to
      this man, and her one dream was to secure comfort and security for her
      child. She had never loved Bradley, and had never pretended to love him.
      She did not wish to bring him any unhappiness. She had, as she expressed
      it, divorced herself, and, according to her conceptions of morality, she
      owed him no obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the more he thought of her and of the fatality of her resurrection,
      the more his whole soul arose in hate against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was one way which led to liberty, the one which she had
      implored him not to take. The law could doubtless at once grant him a
      formal divorce from the woman; but this could not be done without
      publicity, from which his soul shrank in horror. He pictured to himself
      how his adversaries would exult on seeing his name dragged through the
      mud! No; come what might, he would never think of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot follow either his spiritual or his bodily wanderings any further
      at present. He walked the night away, not returning to his hotel until
      early dawn, when, pale, dishevelled, and wild, like a man after a night&rsquo;s
      dissipation (as, indeed, he seemed to the waiter, whose experience of
      clergymen on town visits was not small), he called for his hand-bag, had a
      hasty wash, and crept away to take the morning train.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the morning that
      the Rev. Ambrose Bradley, Vicar of Fensea, had his memorable interview
      with the Bishop of Darkdale and Dells, Miss Alma Craik, of the Larches,
      walked on the home farm in the immediate neighbourhood of her dwelling,
      accompanied by her dear friend and companion Agatha Combe, and attended by
      half a dozen dogs of all sizes, from a melancholy old St. Bernard to a
      frivolous Dandie Dinmont.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies, strolling along side by side, presented a curious
      contrast, which was heightened not a little by their peculiarities of
      costume. Miss Craik, bright as Eos, and tall and graceful as a
      willow-wand, was clad in a pink morning dress, with pink plush hat to
      match, and carried a parasol of the same colour. She walked lightly, with
      a carriage which her detractors called proud, but which her admirers
      thought infinitely easy and charming; conveying to the most casual
      observer that she was a young lady with a will of her own, perfectly
      mistress of herself, and at home among her possessions. Miss Combe, on the
      other hand, was very short, scant of breath, and dressed in a costume
      which looked like widow&rsquo;s weeds, but which was nothing of the sort, for at
      five-and-fifty she was still a virgin. Her face was round and sunny, her
      eyes were bright and cheerful, and few could have recognised, in so homely
      and kindly looking a person, the champion of Woman&rsquo;s Rights, the
      leader-writer of the &lsquo;Morning News,&rsquo; and the champion Agnostic of the
      controversial reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Miss Combe, though mild enough as a woman, was terribly fierce as a
      writer. She had inherited her style and opinions from her father, a friend
      and playfellow (if such an expression may be applied to persons who <i>never</i>
      played) of John Mill. She had been crammed very early with Greek, Latin,
      moral science, and philosophy; and she would certainly have developed into
      a female of the genus Griffin, had it not been for a pious aunt who
      invited her once a year into the country, and there managed to fill her
      lungs with fresh air and her mind with a certain kind of natural religion.
      When Agnosticism was first invented she clutched at the word, and enrolled
      herself as an amazon militant under the banner of the creed. She hated two
      things about equally&mdash;Materialism and dogmatic Christianity. She was,
      in fact, a busy little woman, with a kind heart, and a brain not quite big
      enough to grasp all the issues she was so fond of discussing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Craik had met her in London, and had taken to her immediately&mdash;chiefly,
      if the truth must be told, on account of her opinions; for though Miss
      Craik herself was nominally a Christian, she was already a sufficiently
      lax one to enjoy all forms of heterodoxy. They had come together first on
      one great <i>quoestio revata</i>, that of vivisection, for they both
      adored dogs, and Miss Combe was their most uncompromising champion against
      the users of the scalpel. So it happened in the course of time that they
      spent a part of the year together. The Larches was Miss Combe&rsquo;s house
      whenever she chose to come to it, which was very often, and she became, in
      a certain sense, the companion of her rich young friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their way lay along green uplands with a distant sight of the sea, and
      they followed the footpath which led from field to field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Miss Combe, somewhat out of breath, seated herself on the
      foot-rest of a stile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you take a rest, dear?&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s room for two.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady shook her head. As she fixed her eyes upon her companion,
      one peculiarity of hers became manifest. She was rather short-sighted,
      and, whenever examining anything or anybody, slightly closed her
      eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I were as rich as you,&rsquo; continued Miss Combe after a pause, &lsquo;I know
      what I should do with my money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! pray tell me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should build a church to the New Faith!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you serious?&rsquo; said Alma merrily. &lsquo;Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t know what
      the new faith is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The faith of Humanity; not Comte&rsquo;s, which is Frenchified rubbish, but the
      beautiful faith in human perfection and the divine future of the race.
      Just think what a Church it would make! In the centre an altar &ldquo;to the
      Unknown God&rdquo;; painted windows all round, with the figures of all the great
      teachers, from Socrates to Herbert Spencer, and signs of the zodiac and
      figures of the planets, if you like, on the celestial roof.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see, Agatha, in what respect the new Church would be an
      improvement on the old one,&rsquo; returned Alma; and as she spoke her eyes
      travelled over the still landscape, and saw far away, between her and the
      sea, the glittering spire of the church of Fensea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be different in every particular,&rsquo; said Miss Combe
      good-humouredly. &lsquo;In the first place, the architecture would be, of
      course, pure Greek, and there would be none of the paraphernalia of
      superstition.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Jesus Christ?&mdash;would He have any place there at all? or would
      you banish Him with the rest of the gods?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven forbid! He should be pictured in the very central window, over the
      altar&mdash;not bleeding, horrible, and crucified, but as the happy
      painters represented Him in the early centuries, a beautiful young
      Shepherd&mdash;yes, beautiful as Apollo&mdash;carrying under His arm a
      stray lamb.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma sighed, and shook her head again. She was amused with her friend&rsquo;s
      opinions, and they never seemed to shock her, but her own attitude of mind
      with regard to Christianity was very different.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; she said, still watching the distant spire, &lsquo;If you abolish Christ
      crucified you abolish Christ the Saviour altogether; for sorrow,
      suffering, and death were the signs of His heavenly mission. Besides, I am
      of Mr. Bradley&rsquo;s opinion, and think we have too many churches already.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does <i>he</i> think so?&rsquo; exclaimed Miss Combe with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have often heard him say that God&rsquo;s temple is the best&mdash;the
      open fields for a floor and the vaulted heavens for a roof.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Combe rose, and they strolled on together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he as heterodox as ever?&rsquo; asked Miss Combe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bradley? I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by heterodox, but he has his own
      opinions on the articles of his religion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so. He doesn&rsquo;t believe in the miracles, for example.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you heard him say so?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not explicitly, but I have heard&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t believe all the nonsense you hear,&rsquo; cried Alma eagerly. &lsquo;He
      is too intellectual for the people, and they don&rsquo;t understand him. You
      shall go to church next Sunday, and hear him preach.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m not a church-goer,&rsquo; said the elder lady, smiling. &lsquo;On Sundays I
      always read Herbert Spencer. Sermons are always so stupid.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not always. Wait till you hear Mr. Bradley. When I listen to him, I
      always think of the great Abelard, whom they called the &ldquo;angel of bright
      discourse.&rdquo; He says such wonderful things, and his voice is so beautiful.
      As he speaks, the church seems indeed a narrow place&mdash;too small for
      such words, for such a speaker; and you long to hear him on some mountain
      top, preaching to a multitude under the open sky.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Combe did not answer, but peeping sideways at her companion she saw
      that her face was warmly flushed, and her eyes were strangely bright and
      sparkling. She knew something, but not much, of Alma&rsquo;s relations with the
      vicar, and she hoped with all her heart that they would never lead to
      matrimony. Alma was too wise a vestal, too precious to the cause of
      causes, to be thrown away on a mere country clergyman. In fact, Miss Combe
      had an errant brother of her own who, though an objectionable person, was
      a freethinker, and in her eyes just the sort of husband for her friend. He
      was rather poor, not particularly handsome, and somewhat averse to soap
      and water; but he had held his own in platform argument with divers
      clergymen, and was generally accounted a ticklish subject for the
      Christians. So she presently remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The finest speaker I ever heard is my brother Tom. I wish you could hear
      <i>him</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma had never done so, and, indeed, had never encountered the worthy in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he a clergyman?&rsquo; she asked innocently. &lsquo;Heaven forbid!&rsquo; cried Miss
      Combe. &lsquo;No; he speaks at the Hall of Science.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t quite agree philosophically, for he is too thick with
      Bradlaugh&rsquo;s party, but I know he&rsquo;s coming round to Agnosticism. Poor Tom!
      He is so clever, and has been so unfortunate. He married miserably, you
      know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Alma, not much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was a black-eyed sibyl of a woman who admired one of the Socialist
      lecturers, and when he died actually went to his lodgings, cut off his
      head, and carried it home under her cloak in the omnibus.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horrible!&rsquo; said Alma with a shudder. &lsquo;But what for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To <i>boil</i>, my dear, so that she might keep the skull as a sacred
      relic! When Tom was introduced to her she had it under a glass case on her
      mantelpiece. Well, she was a very intellectual creature, wonderfully
      &ldquo;advanced,&rdquo; as they call it, and Tom was infatuated enough to make her his
      wife. They lived together for a year or so; after which she took to
      Spiritualism, and finally died in a madhouse. So poor Tom&rsquo;s free, and I
      hope when he marries again he&rsquo;ll be more lucky.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Miss Combe did not for a moment believe that her brother would
      have ever had any attraction in the eyes of her rich friend; for Tom Combe
      was the reverse of winsome, even to humbler maidens&mdash;few of whom felt
      drawn to a man who never brushed his hair, had a beard like a Communist
      refugee, and smelt strongly of beer and tobacco. But blood is thicker than
      water, and Miss Combe could not forbear putting in a word in season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word made little or no impression. The stately beauty walked silently
      on full of her own thoughts and dreams.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>oitering slowly
      onward from stile to stile, from field to field, and from pasture to
      pasture, the two ladies at last reached a country road leading right
      through the heart of the parish, and commanding from time to time a view
      of the distant sea. They found Fensea, as usual, fast asleep, basking in
      the midst of its own breath; the red-tiled houses dormant, the population
      invisible, save in the square or market-place opposite the tavern, where a
      drowsy cart-horse was blinking into a water trough, and a somnambulistic
      ostler was vacantly looking on. Even in the open shops such as Radford the
      linendraper&rsquo;s and Summerhayes the grocer&rsquo;s, nothing seemed doing. But just
      as they left the village behind them, and saw in front of them the spire
      of the village church peeping through the trees, they suddenly came face
      to face with a human being who was walking towards them in great haste and
      with some indications of ill-temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, here you are!&rsquo; ejaculated this individual. &lsquo;I have been hunting for
      you up and down.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man under thirty, and looking very little over twenty, though his
      face showed little of the brightness and candour of early manhood. His
      hair was cropped close and he was clean-shaven; his eyes were yellowish
      and large, of an expression so fixed and peculiar as to have been compared
      by irreverent friends to &lsquo;hard-boiled eggs&rsquo;; his forehead was low, his jaw
      coarse and determined. With regard to his dress, it was of the description
      known as horsey; short coat and tight-fitting trousers of light tweed, a
      low-crowned hat of the same material, white neckcloth fastened by a
      horseshoe pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was George Craik, son of Sir George Craik, Bart., of Craik Castle, in
      the neighbourhood, and Alma&rsquo;s cousin on her father&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma greeted him with a nod, while he shook hands with her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ride over, George?&rsquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I put my nag up at the George, and walked up to the Larches. Not
      finding you at home, I strolled down to the vicarage, thinking to find you
      <i>there</i>. But old Bradley is not at home; so I suppose there was no
      attraction to take you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady&rsquo;s cheek flushed, and she looked at her relation, not too
      amicably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Bradley, as you call him (though he is about your own age, I
      suppose), is away in London. Did you want to see him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George shrugged his shoulders, and struck at his boots irritably with his
      riding-whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wanted to see <i>you</i>, as I told you. By the way, though, what&rsquo;s
      this they&rsquo;re telling me about Bradley and the Bishop? He&rsquo;s come to the
      length of his tether at last, I suppose? Well, I always said he was no
      better than an atheist, and a confounded radical into the bargain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An atheist, I presume,&rsquo; returned the young lady superciliously, &lsquo;is a
      person who does not believe in a Supreme Being. When you describe Mr.
      Bradley as one, you forget he is a minister of the Church of Christ.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George Craik scowled, and then laughed contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course <i>you</i> defend him!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;You will tell me next, I
      dare say, that you share his opinions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you explain to me what they are, I will inform you,&rsquo; responded Alma,
      moving slowly on, while George lounged after her, and Miss Combe listened
      in amused amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a scandal,&rsquo; proceeded the young man, &lsquo;that a fellow like that should
      retain a living in the Church. Cripps tells me that his sermon last Sunday
      went slap in the face of the Bible. I myself have heard him say that some
      German fellow had proved the Gospels to be a tissue of falsehoods.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without directly answering this invective, Alma looked coldly round at her
      cousin over her shoulder. Her expression was not encouraging, and her
      manner showed a very natural irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How amiable we are this morning!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;Pray, do you come all
      the way from Craik to give me a discussion on the whole duty of a
      Christian clergyman? Really, George, such attempts at edification have a
      curious effect, coming from <i>you</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man flushed scarlet, and winced nervously under his cousin&rsquo;s too
      ardent contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to be a saint,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I know what I&rsquo;m talking
      about. I call Bradley a renegade! It&rsquo;s a mean thing, in my opinion, to
      take money for preaching opinions in which a man does not believe.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only just now you said that he preached heresy&mdash;or atheism&mdash;whatever
      you like to call it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and is paid for preaching the very reverse.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma could no longer conceal her irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should we discuss a topic you do not understand? Mr. Bradley is a
      gentleman whose aims are too high for the ordinary comprehension, that is
      all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you think me a fool, and are polite enough to say so!&rsquo;
      persisted George. &lsquo;Well, I should not mind so much if Bradley had not
      succeeded in infecting <i>you</i> with his pernicious opinions. He <i>has</i>
      done so, though you may deny it! Since he came to the neighbourhood, you
      have not been like the same girl. The fellow ought to be horsewhipped if
      he had his deserts.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma stopped short, and looked the speaker in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be good enough to leave me,&mdash;and come back when you are in a better
      temper.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George gave a disagreeable laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I&rsquo;m coming to lunch with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you shall not, unless you promise to conduct yourself like a
      gentleman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, hang the parson,&mdash;since you can&rsquo;t bear him to be discussed. I
      didn&rsquo;t come over to quarrel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You generally succeed in doing so, however.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No fault of mine; you snap a fellow&rsquo;s head off, when he wants to give you
      a bit of good advice. &lsquo;There, there,&rsquo; he added, laughing again, but not
      cordially, &lsquo;let us drop the subject. I want something to eat.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma echoed the laugh, with about an equal amount of cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you are talking of what you do understand. Lunch will be served at
      two.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke they were passing by the church gate, and saw, across the
      churchyard, with its long rank grass and tombstones stained with mossy
      slime, the old parish church of Fensea:&mdash;a quaint timeworn structure,
      with an arched and gargoyled entrance, Gothic windows, and a belfry of
      strange device. High up in the belfry, and on the boughs of the great
      ash-trees surrounding the burial acre, jackdaws were gathered, sleepily
      discussing the weather and their family affairs. A footpath, much
      overgrown with grass, crossed from the church porch to a door in the
      weather-beaten wall communicating with the adjacent vicarage&mdash;a
      large, dismal, old-fashioned residence, buried in gloomy foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Combe glanced at church and churchyard with the air of superior
      enlightenment which a Christian missionary might assume on approaching
      some temple of Buddha or Brahma. George, glancing over the wall, uttered
      an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; demanded Alma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brown&rsquo;s blind mare grazing among the graves,&rsquo; said young Craik with
      righteous indignation. He was about to enlarge further on the
      delinquencies of the vicar, and the shameful condition of the parish, of
      which he had just discovered a fresh illustration, but, remembering his
      recent experience, he controlled himself and contented himself with
      throwing a stone at the animal, which was leisurely cropping the grass
      surrounding an ancient headstone. They walked on, and passed the front of
      the vicarage, which looked out through sombre ash-trees on the road. The
      place seemed dreary and desolate enough, despite a few flower-beds and a
      green lawn. The windows were mantled in dark ivy, which drooped in heavy
      clusters over the gloomy door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the vicarage behind them, the three followed the country road for
      about a mile, when, passing through the gate of a pretty lodge, they
      entered an avenue of larch-trees leading up to the mansion to which they
      gave their name. Here all was bright and well kept, the grass swards
      cleanly swept and variegated with flower-beds, and leading on to
      shrubberies full of flowering trees. The house itself, an elegant modern
      structure, stood upon a slight eminence, and was reached by two marble
      terraces commanding a sunny view of the open fields and distant sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be well to explain here that the Larches, with a large extent of
      the surrounding property, belonged to Miss Alma Craik in her own right,
      the lady being an orphan and an only child. Her father, a rich railway
      contractor, had bought the property and built the house just before she
      was born. During her infancy her mother had died, and before she was of
      age her father too had joined the great majority; so that she found
      herself, at a very early age, the heiress to a large property, and with no
      relations in the world save her uncle, Sir George Craik, and his son. Sir
      George, who had been knighted on the completion of a great railway bridge
      considered a triumph of engineering skill, had bought an adjacent property
      at about the time when his brother purchased the lands-of Fensea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same contrast which was noticeable between the cousins had existed
      between the brothers, Thomas and George Craik. They were both Scotchmen,
      and had begun life as common working engineers, but there the resemblance
      ceased. Thomas had been a comparative recluse, thoughtful, melancholy, of
      advanced opinions, fond of books and abstruse speculation; and his
      daughter&rsquo;s liberal education had been the consequence of his culture, and
      in a measure of his radicalism. George was a man of the world, quick, fond
      of money, a Conservative in politics, and a courtier by disposition, whose
      ambition was to found a &lsquo;family,&rsquo; and who disapproved of all social
      changes unconnected with the spread of the railway system and the success
      of his own commercial speculations. Young George was his only son, and had
      acquired, at a very early age, all the instincts (not to speak of many of
      the vices) of the born aristocrat. He was particularly sensitive on the
      score of his lowly origin, and his great grudge against society was that
      it had not provided him with an old-fashioned ancestry. Failing the fact,
      he assumed all the fiction, of an hereditary heir of the soil, but would
      have given half his heirloom to any one who could have produced for him an
      authentic &lsquo;family tree,&rsquo; and convinced him that, despite his father&rsquo;s
      beginnings, his blood had in it a dash of &lsquo;blue.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George Craik lunched with his cousin and her companion in a spacious
      chamber, communicating with the terrace by French windows opening to the
      ground. He was not a conversationalist, and the meal passed in comparative
      silence. Alma could not fail to perceive that the young man was unusually
      preoccupied and taciturn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he rose without ceremony, strolled out on the terrace, and lit a
      cigar. He paced up and down for some minutes, then, with the air of one
      whose mind is made up, he looked in and beckoned to his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come out here,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Never mind your hat&mdash;there is no sun to
      speak of.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, she stepped out and joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you want me?&rsquo; she asked carelessly. &lsquo;I would rather leave you to your
      smoke, and go to the library with Miss Combe. We&rsquo;re studying Herbert
      Spencer&rsquo;s &ldquo;First Principles&rdquo; together, and she reads a portion aloud every
      afternoon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that something was coming by the fixed gaze with which he
      regarded her, and the peculiar expression in his eyes. His manner was far
      less like that of a lover than that of a somewhat sulky and tyrannical
      elder brother,&mdash;and indeed they had been so much together from
      childhood upward that she felt the relation between them to be quite a
      fraternal one. Nevertheless, his mind just then was occupied with a warmer
      sentiment&mdash;the one, indeed, which often leads the way to wedlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began abruptly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Alma, how long is this to last?&rsquo; he demanded not without asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, pray?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our perpetual misunderstandings. I declare if I did not know what a queer
      girl you are, I should think you detested me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like you well enough, George,&mdash;when you are agreeable, which is
      not so often as I could wish.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she answered, with a somewhat weary laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you know I like <i>you</i> better than anything in the world!&rsquo; he
      cried eagerly. &lsquo;You know I have set my heart on making you my wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, George!&rsquo; replied Alma. &lsquo;Love between cousins is an
      absurdity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have added an &lsquo;enormity,&rsquo; having during her vagrant studies
      imbibed strong views on the subject of consanguinity, but, advanced as she
      was, she was not quite advanced enough to discuss a physiological and
      social problem with the man who wanted to marry her. In simple truth, she
      had the strongest personal objection to her cousin, in his present
      character of lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see the absurdity of it,&rsquo; answered the young man, &lsquo;nor does my
      father. His heart is set upon this match, as you know; and besides, he
      does not at all approve of your living the life you do&mdash;alone,
      without a protector, and all that sort of thing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Alma had quite recovered herself, and was able to reassume
      the air of sweet superiority which is at once so bewitching in a pretty
      woman, or so irritating. It did not bewitch George Craik; it irritated him
      beyond measure. A not inconsiderable experience of vulgar amours in the
      country, not to speak of the business known as sowing wild oats&rsquo; in Paris
      and London, had familiarised him with a different type of woman. In his
      cousin&rsquo;s presence he felt, not abashed, but at a disadvantage. She had a
      manner, too, of talking down to him, as to a younger brother, which he
      disliked exceedingly; and more than once, when he had talked to her in the
      language of love, he had smarted under her ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now, instead of taking the matter too seriously, she smiled frankly in
      his face, and quietly took his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not talk like that, George,&rsquo; she said, walking up and down with
      him. &lsquo;When you do, I feel as if you were a very little boy, and I quite an
      old woman. Even if I cared for you in that way&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t, and
      never shall&mdash;we are not at all suited to each other. Our thoughts and
      aims in life are altogether different. I like you very much as a cousin,
      of course, and that is just the reason why I can never think of you as a
      husband. Don&rsquo;t talk of it again, please!&mdash;and forgive me for being
      quite frank&mdash;I should not like you to have any misconception on the
      subject.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what it is,&rsquo; he cried angrily. &lsquo;It is that clergyman fellow! He
      has come between us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing of the sort,&rsquo; answered Alma with heightened colour. &lsquo;If there was
      not another man in the world, it would be all the same so far as you and I
      are concerned.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. Bradley is your choice. A pretty choice! A
      fellow who is almost a beggar, and in a very short time will be kicked out
      of the Church as a heretic.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She released his arm, and drew away from him in deep exasperation; but her
      feeling towards him was still that of an elder sister annoyed at the <i>gaucherie</i>
      of a privileged brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you continue to talk like that of Mr. Bradley, we shall quarrel,
      George. I think you had better go home now, and think it over. In any
      case, you will do no good by abusing an innocent man who is vastly your
      superior.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All the bad blood of George Craik&rsquo;s heart now mounted to his face, and his
      frame shook with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bradley will have to reckon with me,&rsquo; he exclaimed furiously. &lsquo;What right
      has he to raise his eyes towards you? Until he came down here, we were the
      best of friends; but he has poisoned your heart against me, and against
      all your friends. Never mind! I&rsquo;ll have it out with him, before many days
      are done!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without deigning to reply, Alma walked from him into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, George Craik mounted his horse at the inn, and rode
      furiously homeward. An observer of human nature, noticing the expression
      of his countenance, and taking count of his square-set jaw and savage
      mouth, would have concluded perhaps that Alma estimated his opposition,
      and perhaps his whole character, somewhat too lightly. He had a bull-dog&rsquo;s
      tenacity, when he had once made up his mind to a course of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he was gone, the high-spirited lady of his affections dismissed
      him completely from her thoughts. She joined Miss Combe in the library,
      and was soon busy with the problem of the Unknowable, as presented in the
      pages of the clearest-headed philosopher of our time.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>mbrose Bradley
      came back from London a miserable man. Alighting late in the evening at
      the nearest railway station, nearly ten miles distant, he left his bag to
      be sent on by the carrier, and walked home through the darkness on foot.
      It was late when he knocked at the vicarage doer, and was admitted by his
      housekeeper, a melancholy village woman, whose husband combined the
      offices of gardener and sexton. The house was dark and desolate, like his
      thoughts. He shut himself up in his study, and at once occupied himself in
      writing his sermon for the next day, which was Sunday. This task occupied
      him until the early summer dawn crept coldly into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday came, dull and rainy; and Bradley went forth to face his
      congregation with a deepening sense of guilt and shame. A glance showed
      him that Alma occupied her usual place, close under the pulpit, but he was
      careful not to meet her eyes. Not far from her sat Sir George Craik and
      his son, both looking the very reverse of pious minded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very old church, with low Gothic arches and narrow painted
      windows, through which little sunlight ever came. In the centre of the
      nave was the tomb of the old knight of Fensea, who had once owned the
      surrounding lauds, but whose race had been extinct for nearly a century;
      he was depicted, life-size, in crusader&rsquo;s costume, with long two-handed
      sword by his side, and hands crossed lying on his breast. On the
      time-stained walls around were other tombstones, with quaint Latin
      inscriptions, some almost illegible; but one of brand-new marble recorded
      the virtues of Thomas Craik, deceased, the civil engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma noticed in a moment that Bradley was ghastly pale, and that he faced
      his congregation with scarcely a remnant of his old assurance, or rather
      enthusiasm. His voice, however, was clear and resonant as ever, and under
      perfect command.
    </p>
    <p>
      He preached a dreary sermon, orthodox enough to please the most exacting,
      and on an old familiar text referring to those sins which are said, sooner
      or later, to &lsquo;find us out.&rsquo; All those members of the flock who had signed
      the letter to the Bishop were there in force, eager to detect new heresy,
      or confirmation of the old backsliding. They were disappointed, and
      exchanged puzzled looks with one another. Sir George Craik, who had been
      warned by his son to expect something scandalous, listened with a puzzled
      scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service over, Alma lingered in the graveyard, expecting the clergyman
      to come and seek her, as he was accustomed to do. He did not appear; but
      in his stead came her uncle and cousin, the former affectionately
      effusive, the latter with an air of respectful injury. They went home with
      her and spent the afternoon. When they had driven away, she announced her
      intention, in spite of showery weather and slushy roads, of going to
      evening service. Miss Combe expressed her desire of accompanying her, but
      meeting with no encouragement, decided to remain at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were very few people at the church that evening, and the service was
      very short. Again Alma noticed the vicar&rsquo;s death-pale face and always
      averted eyes, and she instinctively felt that something terrible had
      wrought a change in him. When the service was done, she waited for him,
      but he did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards, when it was quite dark, she knocked at the
      vicarage door. It was answered by the melancholy housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Bradley at home? I wish to speak to him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked confused and uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He be in, miss, but I think he be gone to bed wi&rsquo; a headache. He said he
      were not to be disturbed, unless it were a sick call.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Utterly amazed and deeply troubled, Alma turned from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell him that I asked for him,&rsquo; she said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will, miss,&rsquo; was the reply; and the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a heavy heart, Alma walked away Had she yielded to her first impulse,
      she would have returned and insisted on an interview; but she was too
      ashamed. Knowing as she did the closeness of the relationship between
      them, knowing that the man was her accepted lover, she was utterly at a
      loss to account for his extraordinary conduct. Could anything have turned
      his heart against her, or have aroused his displeasure? He had always been
      so different; so eager to meet her gaze and to seek her company. <i>Now</i>,
      it was clear, he was completely changed, and had carefully avoided her;
      nay, she had no doubt whatever, from the housekeeper&rsquo;s manner, that he had
      instructed her to deny him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked on, half pained, half indignant. The night was dark, the road
      desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once she heard footsteps behind her, as of one rapidly running.
      Presently someone came up breathless, and she heard a voice calling her
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it <i>you</i>, Alma?&rsquo; called the voice, which she recognised at once
      as that of Bradley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is I,&rsquo; she answered coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he was by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came after you. I could not let you go home without speaking a word to
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was strangely agitated, and its agitation communicated itself to
      the hearer. She turned to him trembling violently, with an impulsive cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Ambrose, what has happened?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not ask me to-night,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I have thought it all over, I shall be able to explain, but not <i>now</i>.
      My darling, you must forgive me if I seem unkind and rude, but I have been
      in great, great trouble, and even now I can scarcely realise it all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have seen the Bishop?&rsquo; she asked, thinking to touch the quick of his
      trouble, and lead him to confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen him, and, as I expected, I shall have to resign or suffer a
      long persecution. Do not ask me to tell you more yet! Only forgive me for
      having seemed cold and unkind&mdash;I would cut off my right hand rather
      than cause you pain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were walking on side by side in the direction of the &lsquo;Larches.&rsquo; Not
      once did Bradley attempt to embrace the woman he loved, or even to take
      her hand. For a time she retained her self-possession, but at last,
      yielding to the sharp strain upon her heart, she stopped short, and with a
      sob, threw her arms around his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ambrose, why are you so strange? Have we not sworn to be all in all to
      one another? Have I not said that your people shall be my people, your God
      my God? Do not speak as if there was any change. Whatever persecution you
      suffer I have a right to share.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to shrink from her in terror, and tried to disengage himself
      from her embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, my darling! I can&rsquo;t bear it! I need all my strength, and you make
      me weak as a child. All <i>that</i> is over now. I have no right to love
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No right?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None. I thought it might have been, but now I know it is impossible. And
      I am not worthy of you; I was never worthy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ambrose! has your heart then changed?&rsquo; &lsquo;It will never change. I shall
      love you till I die. But now you must see that all is different, that our
      love is without hope and without blessing. There, there; don&rsquo;t weep!&rsquo; &lsquo;You
      will always be the same to me,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Whatever happens, or has
      happened, nothing can part you and me, if your heart is still the same.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not understand!&rsquo; he returned, and as he spoke he gently put her
      aside. &lsquo;All must be as if we had never met. God help me, I am not so lost,
      so selfish, as to involve you in my ruin, or to preserve your love with a
      living lie. Have compassion on me! I will see you again, or better still,
      I will write to you&mdash;and then, you will understand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she could say another word to him he was gone. She stood alone on
      the dark road, not far from the lights of the lodge. She called after him,
      but he gave no answer, made no sign. Terror-stricken, appalled, and
      ashamed, she walked on homeward, and entering the house, passed up to her
      room, locked the door, and had her dark hour alone.

      The next day Alma rose early after a sleepless night. She found awaiting
      her on the breakfast table a letter which had been brought by hand. She
      opened it and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      My Darling,&mdash;Yes, I shall call you so for the last time, though it
      means almost blasphemy. You would gather from my wild words last night
      that what has happened forever puts out of sight and hope my dream of
      making you my wife. You shall not share my degradation. You shall not bear
      the burthen of my unfortunate opinions as a clergyman, now that my social
      and religious plans and aims have fallen like a house of cards. It is not
      that I have ceased to regard you as the one human being that could make
      martyrdom happy for me, or existence endurable. As long as life lasts I
      shall know that its only consecration would have come from you, the best
      and noblest woman I have ever met, or can hope to meet. But the very
      ground has opened under my feet. Instead of being a free agent, as I
      believed, I am a slave, to whom love is a forbidden thing. Even to think
      of it (as I have done once or twice, God help me, in my horror and
      despair) is an outrage upon <i>you</i>. I shall soon be far from here. I
      could not bear to dwell in the same place with one so dear, and to know
      that she was lost to me for ever. Grant me your forgiveness, and if you
      can, forget that I ever came to darken your life. My darling! my darling!
      I cry again for the last time from the depths of my broken heart, that God
      may bless you! For the little time that remains to me I shall have this
      one comfort&mdash;the memory of your goodness, and that you once loved me!
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma read this letter again and again in the solitude of her own chamber,
      and the more she read it the more utterly inscrutable it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Bradley sat alone in his study, a broken and despairing man.
      Before him on his desk lay a letter just written, in which he formally
      communicated to the Bishop his resignation of his living, and begged to be
      superseded as soon as possible. His eyes were red with weeping, his whole
      aspect was indescribably weary and forlorn. So lost was he in his own
      miserable thoughts, that he failed to notice a ring at the outer door, and
      a momentary whispering which followed the opening of the door. In another
      instant the chamber door opened, and a woman, cloaked and veiled, appeared
      upon the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alma!&rsquo; he cried, recognising the figure in a moment, and rising to his
      feet in overmastering agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word she closed the door, and then, lifting her veil to show a
      face as white as marble, gazed at him with eyes of infinite sorrow and
      compassion. Meeting the gaze, and trembling before it, he sank again into
      his chair, and hid his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have come!&rsquo; she said in a low voice; then, without another word,
      she crossed the room and laid her hand softly upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling the tender touch, he shivered and sobbed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, why did you come?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;have read my
      letter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Ambrose,&rsquo; she answered in the same low, far-away, despairing voice.
      &lsquo;That is why I came&mdash;to comfort you if I could. Look up! speak to me!
      I can bear everything if I can only be still certain of your love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He uncovered his face, and gazed at her in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! can you forgive me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have nothing to forgive,&rsquo; she replied mournfully. &lsquo;Can you think that
      my esteem for you is so slight a thing, so light a straw, that even this
      cruel wind of evil fortune can blow it away? I know that you have been
      honourable in word and deed; I know that you are the noblest and the best
      of men. It is no fault of yours, dear, if God is so hard upon us; no, no,
      <i>you</i> are not to blame.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you do not understand! I am a broken man. I must leave this place,
      and&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me,&rsquo; she said, interrupting him with that air of gentle mastery
      which had ever exercised so great a spell upon him, and which gave to her
      passionate beauty a certain splendour of command. &lsquo;Do you think you are
      quite just to <i>me</i> when you speak&mdash;as you <i>have</i> spoken&mdash;of
      leaving Fensea, and bidding me an eternal farewell? Since this trouble in
      the church, you have acted as if I had no part and parcel in your life,
      save that which might come if we were merely married people; you have
      thought of me as of a woman to whom you were betrothed, not as of a loving
      friend whom you might trust till death. Do you think that my faith in you
      is so slight a thing that it cannot survive even the loss of you as a
      lover, if that must be? Do you not know that I am all yours, to the
      deepest fibre of my being, that your sorrow is my sorrow, your God my God&mdash;even
      as I said? I am your sister still, even if I am not to be your wife, and
      whither you go, be sure I shall follow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to her in wonder; for in proportion as he was troubled, she
      was strangely calm, and her voice had a holy fervour before which he bent
      in reverent humiliation. When she ceased, with her soft hand still upon
      his shoulder, he raised his eyes to her, and they were dim with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are too good!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I am the dust beneath your feet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are my hero and my master. As Heloise was to Abelard, so would I be
      to you. So why should you grieve? I shall be to you as before, a loving
      friend, perhaps a comforter, till death separates us in this world, to
      meet in a better and a fairer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands in his own, and kissed them, his tears still falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank God you are so true! But how shall I look you in the face after
      what has happened? You must despise me so much&mdash;yes, yes, you <i>must!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have answered him with fresh words of sweet assurance, but he
      continued passionately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think of the world, Alma! Think of your own future, your own happiness!
      Your life would be blighted, your love wasted, if you continued to care
      for me. Better to forget me! better to say farewell!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do <i>you</i> say that, Ambrose?&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;<i>you</i> who first
      taught me that love once born is imperishable, and that those He has once
      united&mdash;not through the body merely, but through a sacrament of souls&mdash;can
      never be sundered? Nay, you have still your work to do in the world, and I&mdash;shall
      I not help you still? You will not go away?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have written my resignation to the Bishop. I shall quit this place and
      the Church&rsquo;s ministry for ever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not decide in haste,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Is <i>this</i> the letter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she spoke she went to the desk and took the letter in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me <i>burn</i> the letter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alma!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give yourself another week to think it over, for my sake. All this has
      been so strange and so sudden that you have not had time to think it out.
      For my sake, reflect.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She held the letter over the lamp and looked at him for his answer; he
      hung down his head in silence, and, taking the attitude for acquiescence,
      she suffered the paper to reach the flame, and in a few seconds it was
      consumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I must go now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good night! and God bless you, Alma!&rsquo; They parted without one kiss or
      embrace, but, holding each other&rsquo;s hands, they looked long and tenderly
      into each other&rsquo;s faces. Then Alma went as she came, slipping quietly away
      into the night. But no sooner had she left the vicarage than all her
      self-command forsook her, and she wept hysterically under cover of the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, his God is my God,&rsquo; she murmured to herself. &lsquo;May He give me
      strength to bear this sorrow, and keep us together till the end!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;FAREWELL TO FENSEA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>I am sick of time serving. I was borne in the land of Mother-Nakedness;
      she who bare me was a true woman, and my father was sworn vassal to King
      Candour, ere he died of a sunstroke; but villains robbed me of my
      birthright, and I was sent to serve as a mercenary in the army of old
      Hypocrisy, whom all men now hail Emperor and Pope. Now my armour is
      rotten, my sword is broken, and I shall never fight more. Heigho! I would
      I were sleeping under a green tree, in the land where the light shines,
      and there is no lying!&mdash;The Comedy of Counterfeits.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter that night&rsquo;s
      parting the lovers did not meet for several days. Bradley went gloomily
      about his parochial duties, and when he was not so engaged he was shut up
      in his study, engaged in correspondence or gloomy contemplation. Alma did
      not seek him out again, for the very simple reason that the nervous shock
      she had received had seriously affected her generally robust health, and
      brought on a sort of feverish hysteria complicated with sleeplessness, so
      that she kept her room for some days, finding a homely nurse in Miss
      Combe. When Sunday came she was too unwell to go to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon she received the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearest Alma.&mdash;For so I must still call you, since my spirit shrinks
      from addressing you under any more formal name. I have heard that you are
      ill, and I know the cause is not far to seek, since it must lie at the
      door of him whose friendship has brought you so much misery. Pray God it
      is only a passing shadow in your sunny life! An eternity of punishment
      would not adequately meet my guilt if it should seriously imperil your
      happiness or your health! Write to me, since I dare not, must not, come to
      you&mdash;just one word to tell me you are better, and that my fears on
      your account are without foundation. In the pulpit to-day, when I missed
      your dear face, I felt terror-stricken and utterly abandoned. Hell itself
      seemed opening under my feet, and every word I uttered seemed miserable
      blasphemy. I knew then, if I did not know it before, that my faith, my
      religion, my eternal happiness or misery, still depend on <i>you</i>. A.
      B.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later Bradley received this reply
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not distress yourself, dearest. I shall soon be quite well again. I
      have been thinking it all over in solitude, and I feel quite sure that if
      we are patient God will help us. Try to forget your great persecution, and
      think rather of what is more solemn and urgent&mdash;your position in the
      Church, and the justification of your faith before the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ambrose Bradley read the above, and thought it strangely cold and calm; he
      was himself too distracted to read between the lines and perceive the
      bitter anguish of the writer. He still lacked the moral courage to make a
      clean breast of the truth, and confess to Alma that his change had come
      through that sad discovery in London. He dreaded her sorrow more than her
      anger; for he knew, or feared, that the one unpardonable sin in her eyes
      would be&mdash;to have loved another woman. She had no suspicion of the
      truth. An entanglement of a disgraceful kind, involving the life of a
      person of her own sex, was the last thing to occur to her mind in
      connection with her lover. She attributed everything, his change of
      manner, his strange passion, his unreasoning despair, to the exquisite
      sensitiveness of a proudly intellectual nature. How deluded she was by her
      own idolatry of his character the reader knows. What cared he for the
      Church&rsquo;s inquisition <i>now</i>? What cared he for dogmatic niceties, or
      spiritual difficulties, or philosophic problems? He was sick of the whole
      business, The great problem troubled him no longer, save that he felt more
      and more in revolt against any kind of authority, more and more tired of
      the sins and follies and blind fatalities of the world. Even her tender
      appeals to his vanity seemed trivial and beside the question. His ambition
      was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again he tried to summon up courage enough to make a complete
      explanation; but his heart failed him, and so he temporised. He <i>could</i>
      not say the word which, in all probability, would sunder them for ever. He
      would wait; perhaps Heaven, in its mercy, might relieve him, and justify
      him. In his own mind he felt himself a martyr; yet he could escape the
      sense of contamination consequent on the possession of so guilty a secret.
      The pure currents of his life seemed poisoned,&mdash;as indeed they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was a perilous one. Behind all Alma&rsquo;s assumption of tender
      acquiescence, she was deeply wounded by her lover&rsquo;s want of confidence in
      her devotion. His manner had shocked her inexpressibly, more even than she
      yet knew, yet it only drew her more eagerly towards him. In her despair
      and anger, she turned to the topic which, from the first moment of their
      acquaintance, had been constantly upon his tongue, and she tried to
      persuade herself that her strongest feeling towards him was religious and
      intellectual. In reality, she was hungering towards him with all the
      suppressed and suffocating passion of an unusually passionate nature. Had
      he been a reckless man, unrestrained by moral sanctions, she would have
      been at his mercy. So implicit was her faith in the veracity of his
      perception, and so strong at the same time was his personal attraction for
      her, that she might have been ready, for his sake, had he told her the
      whole truth, to accept as right any course of conduct, however
      questionable, which he might sanctify as right and just.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all this it will be gathered that Miss Alma Craik was in a position
      of no inconsiderable peril. She had long been dwelling far too much in the
      sphere of ideas, not to say crotchets, for a young lady without
      protectors. Her one safeguard was her natural purity of disposition,
      coupled with her strength of will. She was not the sort of woman to be
      seduced into wrong-doing, as weak women are seduced, against her
      conscience. Any mistake she might make in life was certain to be the
      result of her own intellectual acquiescence,&mdash;or of wilful deception,
      which indeed was imminent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the days passed on, in deepening gloom; for the situation was a
      wretched one. Many other letters were interchanged, but the two seldom
      met, and when they did it was only briefly and in the presence of other
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a life of torture, and could not last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the Bishop of the diocese had not been idle. He had consulted
      with the powers of the Church, and all had come to one conclusion&mdash;that
      under any circumstances, a public scandal must be avoided. Pending any
      action on the part of his superiors, Bradley gave no fresh occasion for
      offence. His sermons became old-fashioned, not to say infantine. For the
      rest, he was ready to resign at a moment&rsquo;s notice; and he wrote to the
      Bishop to that effect, inviting him to choose a successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After thinking the matter well over,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;I have concluded that
      your lordship is right, and that my opinions are at present out of harmony
      with the principles of the Establishment. A little while ago I might have
      been inclined to stand my ground, or at any rate not to yield without a
      protest; but my mind has changed, and I shall resign without a murmur. Nor
      shall I seek another living in the English Church as at present
      constituted. Even if I were likely to succeed in my search, I should not
      try. Let me depart in peace, and rely on my uttering no syllable which can
      be construed into resistance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop answered him eagerly, in the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Sir,&mdash;I think you have decided wisely, and I am grateful to
      you for the temper in which you have accepted the situation. You have the
      spirit of a true Christian, though your ideas are errant from the great
      principles of Christianity. What I would suggest is this, and I hope it
      will meet with your approval:&mdash;that under the plea of ill-health, or
      some similar pretext, you offer your resignation, and withdraw <i>temporarily</i>
      from your ministry. I say temporarily, because I believe that a brief
      period of reflection will bring you back to us with all your original
      enthusiasm, with all the fresh faith and fervour of your first days. When
      that time comes, the Church, I need not say, will remember your
      self-sacrifice, and receive you back in due season like the Prodigal Son.
      Until then, believe me, now as ever, your faithful friend and well-wisher,
    </p>

    <p>
      The result of this correspondence was speedily seen in a paragraph which
      appeared in the &lsquo;Guardian&rsquo;:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We understand that the Rev. Ambrose Bradley, M.A., vicar of Fensea, has
      resigned his living on account of continued ill-health. The living is in
      the gift of the Bishop of the diocese, who has not yet appointed a
      successor.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This paragraph was copied into the the local paper, and when they read it,
      the Craiks (father and son) were exultant. Alma saw it also, but as
      Bradley had privately intimated his decision to her, it caused her no
      surprise. But an affair of so much importance was not destined to be
      passed over so quietly. A few days later, a paragraph appeared in some of
      the more secular journals to the effect that the Vicar of Fensea had
      &lsquo;seceded&rsquo; from the Christian Church, on account of his inability to accept
      its dogmas, more particularly the Miracles and the Incarnation. The
      announcement fell like a thunderbolt, and no one was more startled by it
      than the clergyman himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He at once sat down and wrote the following letter to the &lsquo;Guardian&rsquo;:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;I have seen with much pain a paragraph in several journals to
      the effect that my reason for resigning the living of Fensea is because I
      have ceased to believe in the essential truths of Christianity. Permit me
      with indignation to protest against this unwarrantable imputation, both
      upon myself and upon a religion for which I shall always have the deepest
      reverence. My reasons for ceasing to hold office are known to the Church
      authorities alone. It is enough to say that they are partly connected with
      physical indisposition, and partly with private matters with which the
      public has nothing to do. I believe now, as I have always believed, that
      the Church of England possesses within herself the secret which may yet
      win back an errant world into the fold of Christian faith. In ceasing to
      hold office as a Christian clergyman, I do not cease in my allegiance to
      Jesus Christ or to the Church He founded; and all assertions to the
      contrary are quite without foundation.&mdash;I am, Sir, &amp;c.,
    </p>
    <p>
      Ambrose Bradley.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen that this epistle was couched in the most ambiguous terms;
      it was perfectly true, yet thoroughly misleading, as indeed it was meant
      to be. When he had written and posted it, Bradley felt that he had reached
      the depth of moral humiliation. Still, he had not the heart just then to
      say anything which might do injury, directly or indirectly, to the
      Establishment in which he had been born and bred.

      <i>Ambrose Bradley to Alma Craik.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Versailles,&mdash;, 18&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>earest Alma,&mdash;I
      came here from Rouen this day week, and have more than once sat down to
      write to you; but my heart was too full, and the words would not come,
      until to-day. Since we parted&mdash;since at your loving intercession I
      consented to wander abroad for a year, and to write you the record of my
      doings from time to time&mdash;I have been like a man in the Inferno,
      miserable, despairing, thinking only of the Paradise from which he has
      fallen; in other words, my sole thought has been of the heavenly days now
      past, and of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I must not talk of that; I must conquer my passionate words and try
      to write coldly, dispassionately, according to promise, of the things that
      I have seen. That I can do so at all, will be a proof to you, my darling,
      that I am already much better. Another proof is that I am almost able (as
      you will see when you read on) to resume my old British prerogative of
      self-satisfied superiority over everything foreign, especially over
      everything French. It is extraordinary how thoroughly national even a
      cold-blooded cosmopolite becomes when he finds himself daily confronted by
      habits of thought he does not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am staying at a small hotel on the Paris side of Versailles, within easy
      reach of the gay city either by train or tram. I have exchanged my white
      neckcloth for a black necktie, and there is nothing in my dress or manner
      to mark me out for that most disagreeable of fishes out of water&mdash;a
      Parson in Paris! I see my clerical brethren sometimes, white-tied,
      black-coated, broad-brim&rsquo;d-hatted, striding along the boulevards
      defiantly, or creeping down bye-streets furtively, or peeping like guilty
      things into the windows of the photograph shops in the Rue Rivoli. As I
      pass them by in my rough tourist&rsquo;s suit, they doubtless take me for some
      bagman out for a holiday; and I&mdash;I smile in my sleeve, thinking how
      out of place they seem, here in Lutetia of the Parisians.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my heart goes out most to those other brethren of mine, who draw their
      light from Rome. One pities them deeply <i>now</i>, in the time of their
      tribulation, as they crawl, forlorn and despised, about their weary work.
      The public prints are full of cruel things concerning them, hideous
      lampoons, unclean caricatures; what the Communist left surviving the
      journalist daily hacks and stabs. And indeed, the whole of this city
      presents the peculiar spectacle of a people without religion, without any
      sort of spiritual aspiration. Even that vague effluence of transcendental
      liberalism, which is preached by some of their leading poets and thinkers,
      is pretty generally despised, Talking with a leading bookseller the other
      day concerning your idol, Victor Hugo, and discussing his recent
      utterances on religious subjects, I found the good <i>bourgeois</i> to be
      of opinion that the great poet&rsquo;s brain was softening through old age and
      personal vanity! The true hero of the hour, now all the tinsel of the
      Empire is rubbed away, is a writer named Zola, originally a printer&rsquo;s
      devil, who is to modern light literature what Schopenhauer is to
      philosophy&mdash;a dirty, muddy, gutter-searching pessimist, who
      translates the &lsquo;anarchy&rsquo; of the ancients into the bestial <i>argot</i> of
      the Quarties Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been very well said by a wit of this nation that if on any fine day
      the news arrived in Paris that &lsquo;<i>God was dead</i>,&rsquo; it would not cause
      the slightest astonishment or interest in a single <i>salon</i>; indeed,
      to all political intents and purposes the Divinity is regarded as extinct.
      A few old-fashioned people go to church, and here and there in the streets
      you see little girls in white going to confirmation; but the majority of
      the people are entirely without the religious sentiment in any form. A
      loathsome publication, with hideous illustrations, called the <i>Bible
      pour Rire</i>, is just now being issued in penny numbers; and the
      character of its humour may be guessed when I tell you that one of the
      pictures represents the &lsquo;bon Dieu,&rsquo; dressed like an old clothesman,
      striking a lucifer on the sole of his boot, while underneath are the
      words, &lsquo;And God said, Let there be Light!&rsquo; The same want of good taste, to
      put reverence aside as out of the question, is quite as manifest in the
      higher literature, as where Hugo himself, in a recent poem, thus describes
      the Tout-Puissant, or All-Powerful:-

    <p>
      Is it any wonder that a few simple souls, who still cherish a certain
      reverence for the obsolete orthodox terminology should go over in despair
      to Rome?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the great questions of the day, discussed in a spirit of the most
      brutal secularity, is Divorce. I know your exalted views on this subject,
      your love of the beautiful old fashion which made marriage eternal, a
      sacrament of souls, not to be abolished even by death itself. Well, our
      French neighbours wish to render it a simple contract, to be dissolved at
      the whim of the contracting-parties. Their own social life, they think, is
      a living satire on the old dispensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I sat down to write you a letter about myself, and here I am prosing
      about the idle topics of the day, from religion to the matrimonial musical
      glasses. I am wonderfully well in body; in fact, never better. But oh, my
      Alma, I am still miserably sick of soul! More than ever do I perceive that
      the world wants a creed. When the idea of God is effaced from society, it
      becomes&mdash;this Paris&mdash;a death&rsquo;s head with a mask of pleasure:&mdash;

      All my foolish plans have fallen like a house of cards. I myself seem
      strangling in the evils of the modern snake of Pessimism. If it were not
      for you, my guardian angel, my star of comfort, I think I should try
      euthanasia. Write to me! Tell me of yourself, of Fensea; no news that
      comes from my heaven on earth will fail to interest and soothe me. What do
      you think of my successor? and what does the local Inquisition think of
      him? Next to the music of your voice will be the melody of your written
      words. And forgive this long rambling letter. I write of trifles light as
      air, because I <i>cannot</i> write of what is deepest in my heart.&mdash;Yours

      <i>From Alma Craik to Ambrose Bradley.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hanks, dearest
      Ambrose, for your long and loving letter. It came to me in good season,
      when I was weary and anxious on your account, and I am grateful for its
      good tidings and its tone of growing cheerfulness. You see my prescription
      is already working wonders, for you wrote like your old self&mdash;almost!
      I am so glad that you are well in health, so thankful you are beginning to
      forget your trouble. If such a cure is possible in a few short weeks, what
      will time not do in a year?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no news, that is, none worth telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your successor (since you ask concerning him) is a mild old gentleman with
      the most happy faith in <i>all</i> the articles of the Athanasian creed&mdash;particularly
      that of eternal punishment, which he expounds with the most benevolent of
      smiles. I should say he will be a favourite; indeed, he is a favourite
      already, though he has the disadvantage, from the spinster point of view,
      of being a very, very married man. He has a wife and seven children, all
      girls, and is far too poor in this world&rsquo;s goods to think much of his
      vested interest in those of the next world. I have heard him preach once,
      which has sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you say of life in France interests me exceedingly, and my heart
      bleeds for those poor priests of the despised yet divine creed. If you had
      not taught me a purer and a better faith, I think I should be a Roman
      Catholic, and even as it is, I can feel nothing but sympathy for the
      Church which, after all, possesses more than all others the form of the
      Christian tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agatha Combe has returned to London. She is still full of that beautiful
      idea (was it yours or mine, or does it belong to both of us?) of the New
      Church, in which Religion, Science, and Art should all meet together in
      one temple, as the handmaids of God. I hope you have not dismissed it from
      your mind, or forgotten that, at a word from you, it may be realised.
      Agatha&rsquo;s conception of it was, I fear, a little too secular; her Temple of
      worship would bear too close a resemblance to her brother&rsquo;s dingy Hall of
      Science. She has just finished a treatise, or essay, to be published in
      one of the eclectic magazines, the subject, &lsquo;Is growth possible to a
      dogmatic religion?&rsquo; Her answer is in the negative, and she is dreadfully
      severe on what she calls the &lsquo;tinkering&rsquo; fraternity, particularly her <i>bête
      noire</i>, young Mr. Mallock. Poor Agatha! She should have been a man by
      rights, but cruel fate, by just a movement of the balance, made her the
      dearest of old maids, and a Blue! Under happier conditions, with just a
      little less of the intellectual leaven, she would have made a capital wife
      for such a parson as your successor; for in spite of her cleverness, and
      what they call her infidelity, she is horribly superstitious&mdash;won&rsquo;t
      pass a pin in the road without lifting it up, throws salt over her
      shoulder if she happens to spill a morsel, and can tell your fortune by
      the cards! Besides all this, she is a born humanitarian; her thoughts for
      ever running on the poor, and flannel, and soup-kitchens, and (not to
      leave the lower animals out of her large heart) the woes of the vivisected
      dogs and rabbits. And yet, when the pen is in her hand and her
      controversial vein is open, she hurls her argumentative thunderbolts about
      like a positive Demon!
    </p>
    <p>
      There, I am trying to rattle on, as if I were a giddy girl of eighteen.
      But my heart, like yours, is very full. Sometimes I feel as if you were
      lost to me for ever; as if you were gone into a great darkness, and would
      never come back. Dearest, you think of me sometimes&mdash;nay, often?&mdash;and
      when your wound is healed, you will come back to me, better and stronger
      and happier than ever, will you not? For am I not your Rachel, who still
      follows you in soul wherever you go? I sit here for hours together,
      thinking of the happy days that are fled for ever; then I wander out to
      the churchyard, and look at the dear old vicarage, and wherever I go I
      find some traces of him I love. Yesterday I went over to the abbey. Do you
      remember, dear, when we last met there, and swore our troth in the
      moonlight, with our ears full of the solemn murmuring of the sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      That reminds me of what you say concerning the French agitation on the
      subject of Divorce. I read some time ago an abstract of M. Naquet&rsquo;s famous
      discourse&mdash;it was published in the English newspapers&mdash;and I
      felt ashamed and sad beyond measure. How low must a nation have fallen
      when one of its politicians dares to measure with a social foot-rule the
      holiest of human covenants! If marriage is a bond to be worn or abandoned
      at pleasure, if there is nothing more sacred between man and woman than
      the mere union of the body, God help us women, and <i>me</i> most of all!
      For has not God already united my soul to yours, not as yet by the
      sacrament of the Church, but by that sacrament of Love which is also
      eternal; and if we were spiritually sundered, should I not die; and if I
      thought that Death could break our sacrament of Love, should I not become
      even as those outcast ones who believe there is no God? I have never loved
      another man; you have never loved (how often have you not sworn it to me!)
      another woman. Well, then, can man ever separate what God has so joined
      together? Even if we were never man and wife in the conventional sense,
      even if we never stand together at the earthly altar, in the eyes of
      Heaven we are man and wife, and we have been united at the altar of God.
      This, at least, is my conception of Marriage.

      Between those that love, Divorce (as these hucksters call it) is
      impossible.

      Alas! I write wildly, and my Abelard will smile at his handmaid&rsquo;s eager
      words. &lsquo;Me-thinks the lady doth protest too much,&rsquo; I hear him exclaim with
      Shakespeare. But I know that you hold with me that those things are holy
      beyond vulgar conception.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>earest Alma,&mdash;Just
      a few lines to say that I am going on to Germany; I will write to you
      again directly I come to an anchorage in that brave land. For I am sick of
      France and Frenchmen; sick of a people that have not been lessoned by
      misfortune, but still hunger for aggression and revenge; sick of the Dead
      Sea fruit of Parisian pleasure, poisoned and heart-eaten by the
      canker-worm of unbelief. Our English poetess is virtuously indignant (you
      remember) with those who underrate this nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The English have a scornful insular way
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of calling the French light, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is true they are not light, but with the weight of their own blind
      vanity, heavy as lead. The curse of spiritual dulness is upon them. They
      talk rhodomontade and believe in nothing. How I burn for the pure
      intellectual air of that nobler people which, in the name of the God of
      Justice, recently taught France so terrible a lesson! Here, in France,
      every man is a free agent, despising everything, the government which he
      supports! the ideas which he fulminates, despising most his own free,
      frivolous, miserable self: there, in Germany, each man is a patriot and a
      pillar of the state, his only dream to uphold the political fabric of a
      great nation. To efface one&rsquo;s selfish interest is the first step to
      becoming a good citizen; to believe in the government of God, follows as a
      natural consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you say about our spiritual union, touches me to the soul, though it
      is but the echo of my own fervent belief. But I am not so sure that <i>all</i>
      earthly unions, even when founded in affection and good faith, are
      indissoluble. Surely also, there are marriages which it is righteous to
      shatter and destroy?
    </p>
    <p>
      You are a pure woman, to whom even a thought of impurity is impossible;
      but alas! all women are not made in the same angelic mould, and we see
      every day the spectacle of men linked to partners in every respect
      unworthy. Surely you would not hold that the union of a true man with a
      false woman, a woman who (for example) was untrue to her husband in
      thought and deed, is to last for ever? I know that is the Catholic
      teaching, that marriage is a permanent sacrament, and that no act of the
      parties, however abominable, can render either of them free to marry
      again; and we find even such half-hearted Liberals as Gladstone upholding
      it (see his &lsquo;Ecclesiastical Essays&rsquo;), and flinging mud in the blind face
      of Milton, because (out of the bitterness of his own cruel experience) he
      argued the contrary. Divorce is recognised in our own country and
      countenanced by our own religion; and I believe it to be necessary for the
      guarantee of human happiness. What is most hideous in our England is the
      horrible institution of the civil Court, where causes that should be heard
      <i>in camerâ</i> are exposed shamefully to the light of day; so that men
      would rather bear their life-long torture than submit to the ordeal of a
      degrading publicity, and only shameless men and women dare to claim their
      freedom at so terrible a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intended to write only a few lines, and here am I arguing with you on
      paper, just as we used to argue in the old times <i>viva voce</i>, on a
      quite indifferent question. Forgive me! And yet writing so seems like
      having one of our nice, long, cosy, serious talks. Discussions of this
      kind are like emptying one&rsquo;s pocket to find what they contain; I never
      thought I had any ideas on the subject till I began, schoolboy-like, to
      turn them out!
    </p>
    <p>
      God bless you, my darling! When you hear from me next, I shall be in the
      land ol the &lsquo;ich&rsquo; and the &lsquo;nicht ich,&rsquo; of beer and philosophy, of

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>earest Ambrose,&mdash;You
      are right in supposing that your letter from Berlin went astray; it has
      certainly never reached me, and you can imagine my impatience in
      consequence. However, all&rsquo;s well that ends well; and the sight of your
      dear handwriting is like spring sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I last wrote to you I have been reading-in a French translation
      those wonderful letters of Héloïse to the great Abelard, and his to her;
      and somehow they seemed to bring you close to me, to recall your dear
      face, the very sound of your beautiful voice. Dearest, what would you have
      said if I had addressed this letter to you in the old sweet terms used by
      my prototype&mdash;not for the world to see, but for your loving eyes
      alone? &lsquo;A son maître, ou plutôt à son père; à son époux, ou plutôt à son
      frère: sa servante, ou plutôt sa fille; son épouse, ou plutôt sa sour; à
      Ambrose, Alma.&rsquo; All these and more are you to me, my master and my father,
      my husband and my brother; while I am at once your servant and your
      daughter, your sister and your spouse. Do you believe, did you ever feel
      inclined to believe, in the transmigration of souls? As I read these
      letters, I seem to have lived before, in a stranger, stormier time; and
      every word <i>she</i> wrote seemed to be the very echo of my burning
      heart. Ah! but our lot is happier, is it not? There is no shadow of sin
      upon <i>us</i> to darken our loving dream: we have nothing to undo,
      nothing to regret; and surely our spiritual union is blest by God. For
      myself, I want only one thing yet to complete my happiness&mdash;to see
      you raised as <i>he</i> was raised to a crown of honour and glory in the
      world. What I think of you, all mankind must think of you, when they know
      you as I know you, my apostle of all that is great and good. Ah, dearest,
      I would gladly die, if by so doing I could win you the honour you deserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must stop now. When I begin to write to you, I scarcely know when to
      cease. <i>Adieu, tout mon bien!</i>

    <p>
      <i>Ambrose Bradley to Alma Craik</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A Alma, sa bien-aimée épouse et sour en Jésus-Christ, Ambrose son époux
      et frère en Jésus-Christ!&rsquo; Shall I begin thus, dearest, in the very words
      of the great man to whom, despite my undeserving, you have lovingly
      compared me? You see I remember them well. But alas! Abelard was thrown on
      different days, when at least faith was <i>possible</i>. What would he
      have become, I wonder, had he been born when the faith was shipwrecked,
      and when the trumpet of Euroclydon was sounding the destruction of all the
      creeds? Yonder, in France, one began to doubt everything, even the
      divinity of love; so I fled from the Parisian Sodom, trusting to find hope
      and comfort among the conquerors of Sedan. Alas! I begin to think that I
      am a sort of modern Diogenes, seeking in vain for a people with a Soul. I
      went first to Berlin, and found there all the vice of Paris without its
      beauty, all the infidelity of Frenchmen without their fitful enthusiasm in
      forlorn causes. The people of Germany, it appears to me, put God and
      Bismarck in the same category; they accept both as a solution of the
      political difficulty, but they truly reverence neither. The typical German
      is a monstrosity, a living-contradiction: intellectually an atheist, he
      assents to the conventional uses of Deity; politically a freethinker, he
      is a slave to the idea of nationality and a staunch upholder of the divine
      right of kings. Long ago, the philosophers, armed with the jargon of an
      insincere idealism, demolished Deism with one hand and set it up with the
      other; what they proved by elaborate treatises not to exist, they
      established as the only order of things worth believing; till at last the
      culmination of philosophic inconsistency was reached in Hegel, who began
      by the destruction of all religion and ended in the totem-worship of
      second childhood. In the course of a very short experience, I have learned
      cordially to dislike the Germans, and to perceive that, in spite of their
      tall talk and their splendid organisation, they are completely without
      ideas. In proportion as they have advanced politically, they have
      retrograded intellectually. They have no literature now and no philosophy;
      in one word, no spiritual zeal. They have stuck up as their leader a man
      with the moral outlook of Brander in &lsquo;Faust,&rsquo; a swashbuckler politician,
      who swaggers up and down Europe and frowns down liberalism wherever it
      appears. Upon my word, I even preferred the Sullen Talent which he
      defeated at Sedan.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I see you smiling at my seeming anger; but I am not angry at all&mdash;only
      woefully disenchanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This muddy nation stupefies me like its own beer. Its morality is a sham,
      oscillating between female slavery in the kitchen and male drunkenness in
      the beer-garden. The horrible military element predominates everywhere;
      every shopkeeper is a martinet, every philosopher a dull sergeant. And
      just in time to reap the fruit of the predominant materialism or realism,
      has arisen the new Buddha Gautama without his beneficence, his beauty, his
      tenderness, or his love for the species.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in Frankfort (which I came to eagerly, thinking of its famous
      Judenstrasse, and eager to find the idea of the &lsquo;one God&rsquo; at least among
      the Jews), I walk in the new Buddha&rsquo;s footsteps wherever I go.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name was Arthur Schopenhauer, a German of Germans, with the one
      non-national merit, that he threw aside the mask of religion and morality.
      He was a piggish, selfish, conceited, <i>honest</i> scoundrel, fond of
      gormandising, in love with his own shadow, miserable, and a money-grubber
      like all his race. One anecdote they tell of him is worth a thousand, as
      expressing the character of the man. Seated at the table d&rsquo;hôte here one
      day, and observing a stranger&rsquo;s astonishment at the amount he was
      consuming, Schopenhauer said, &lsquo;I see you are astonished, sir, that I eat
      twice as much as you, but the explanation is simple&mdash;<i>I have twice
      as much brains!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of this Heliogabalus of pessimism was that life is altogether an
      unmixed evil; that all things are miserable of necessity, even the birds
      when they sing on the green boughs, and the babes when they crow upon the
      breast; and that the only happiness, to be secured by every man as soon as
      possible, and the sooner the better, was in Nirwâna, or total extinction.
      A cheerful creed, without a God of any kind&mdash;nay, without a single
      godlike sentiment! There are pessimists and pessimists. Gautama Buddha
      himself, <i>facile princeps</i>, based his creed upon infinite pity; his
      sense of the sorrows of his fellow-creatures was so terrible as to make
      existence practically unbearable. John Calvin was a Christian pessimist;
      his whole nature was warped by the sense of infinite sin and overclouded
      by the shadow of infinite justice. But this Buddha of the Teutons is a
      different being; neither love nor pity, only a predominating selfishness
      complicated with constitutional suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, poor man, he was happy enough when his disciples hailed him as
      the greatest philosopher of the age, the clearest intellect on the planet;
      and nothing is more touching than to witness how, as his influence grew,
      and he emerged from neglect, his faith in human nature brightened. Had he
      lived a little longer and risen still higher in esteem&mdash;had the
      powers that be crowned him, and the world applauded him, he too, like
      Hegel, would doubtless have added to his creed a corollary that, though
      there is no God, religion is an excellent thing; that though there is no
      goodness, virtue is the only living truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, I am thoroughly convinced that there is no <i>via media</i>
      between Christ&rsquo;s Christianity and Schopenhauer&rsquo;s pessimism; and these two
      religions, like the gods of good and evil, are just now preparing for a
      final struggle on the battle-field of European thought. Just at present I
      feel almost a pessimist myself, and inclined to laugh more than ever at
      poor Kingsley&rsquo;s feeble twaddle about this &lsquo;singularly well-constructed
      world.&rsquo; Every face I see, whether of Jew or Gentile, is scribbled like the
      ledger with figures of addition and subtraction; every eye is crowsfooted
      with tables of compound interest; and the moneybags waddle up and down the
      streets, and look out of the country house windows, like things without a
      soul. But across the river, at Sachsenhausen, there are trees, in which
      the birds sing, and pretty children, and lovers talking in the summer
      shade. I go there in the summer afternoons and smoke my pipe, and think
      over the problem of the time. Think you, dearest, that Schopenhauer was
      right, and that there is no gladness or goodness in the world? Is the
      deathblow of foolish supernaturalism the destruction also of heavenly love
      and hope? Nay, God forbid! But this hideous pessimism is the natural
      revolt of the human heart, after centuries of optimistic lies. Perhaps,
      when another century has fled, mankind may thank God for Schopenhauer, who
      proved the potency of materialistic Will, and for Strauss, who has shown
      the fallacy of human judgment. The Germans have given us these two men as
      types of their own degradation; and when we have thoroughly digested their
      bitter gospel, we shall know how little hope for humanity lies <i>that</i>
      way. Meantime, the Divine Ideal, the spiritual Christ survives&mdash;the
      master of the secret of sorrow, the lord of the shadowy land of hope. He
      turns his back upon the temple erected in his name; he averts his sweet
      eyes from those who deny He is, or ever was. He is patient, knowing that
      his kingdom must some day come.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than ever now do I feel what a power the Church might be if it would
      only reconstruct itself by the light of the new knowledge. Without it,
      both France and Germany are plunged into darkness and spiritual death. As
      if man, constituted as he is, can exist without religion! As if the creed
      of cakes and ale, or the gospel of Deutschthum and Sauer-kraut were in any
      true sense of the word religion at all! No, the hope and salvation of the
      human race lies now, as it lay eighteen hundred years ago, in the
      Christian promise. If this life were all, if this world were the play and
      not the prelude, then the new Buddha would have conquered, and nothing be
      left us but Nirwâna. But the Spirit of Man, which has created Christ and
      imagined God, knows better. It trusts its own deathless instinct, and by
      the same law through which the swallow wings its way, it prepares for
      flight to a sunnier zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pray, my Alma, that even this holy instinct is not merely a dream! Pray
      that God may keep us together till the time comes to follow the summer of
      our love to its bright and heavenly home!&mdash;Yours till death, and
      after death,

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>our last letter,
      dearest Ambrose, has reached me here in London, where I am staying for a
      short time with Agatha Combe. Everybody is out of town, and even the
      Grosvenor Club (where I am writing this letter) is quite deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never like London so much as when it is empty of everybody that one
      knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so you find the Germans as shallow as the French, and as far away from
      the living truth it is your dream to preach? For my own part, I think they
      must be rather a <i>stupid</i> people, in spite of their philosophic airs.
      Agatha has persuaded me lately to read a book by a man called Haeckel, who
      is constructing the whole history of Evolution as children make drawings,
      out of his own head; and when the silly man is at a loss for a link in the
      chain, he invents one, and calls it by a Latin name! I suppose Evolution
      is true (and I know you believe in it), but if I may trust my poor woman&rsquo;s
      wit, it proves nothing whatever. The mystery of life remains just the same
      when all is said and done; and I see as great a miracle in a drop of
      albumen passing through endless progressions till it flowers in sense and
      soul, as in the creation of all things at the fiat of an omnipotent
      personal God and Father. The poor purblind German abolishes God
      altogether!
    </p>
    <p>
      Agatha has read your Schopenhauer, and thinks him a wonderful man; I
      believe, too, he has many disciples in this country. To me, judging from
      what I hear of him, and also from your description of him, he seems
      another <i>stupid</i> giant&mdash;a Fee-fo-fi-fum full of self-conceit and
      hasty pudding, and sure to fall a victim, some day, to Little Jack Horner.
      But every word you write (it seems always like your own dear voice
      speaking!) makes me think of yourself, of your quarrel with the Church,
      and of your justification before the world. If purblind men like these can
      persuade the world to listen to them, why should your &lsquo;one talent, which
      is death to lose,&rsquo; be wasted or thrown away? When you have wandered a
      little longer, you must return and take your place as a teacher and a
      preacher in the land, You must not continue to be an exile. You are my
      hero, my Abelard, my teacher of all that is great and good to a perverse
      generation, and I shall never be happy until you reach the summit of your
      spiritual ambition and are recognised as a modern apostle. You <i>must not</i>
      leave the ministry; you must not abandon your vocation; or if you do so,
      it must be only to change the scene of your labours. Agatha Combe tells me
      that there is a great field for a man like you in London; that the
      cultivated people here are sick of the old dogmas, and yet equally sick of
      mere materialism; that what they want is a leader such as you, who would
      take his stand upon the laws of&rsquo; reason, and preach a purified and exalted
      Christian ideal. Well, since the English Establishment has rejected you,
      why not, in the greatest city of the world, form a Church of your own? I
      have often thought of this, but never so much as lately. There you are
      tongue-tied and hand-tied, at the mercy of the ignorant who could never
      comprehend you; <i>here</i> you could speak with a free voice, as the
      great Abelard did when he defied the thunders of the Vatican. Remember, I
      am rich. You have only to say the word, and your handmaid (am I not still
      <i>that</i>, and your spouse and your <i>sister</i>?) will upbuild you a
      Temple! Ah, how proudly!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, think of <i>this</i>, think of the great work of your life, not of
      its trivial disappointments. Be worthy of my dream of you, my Abelard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I see you wear your crown of honour with all the world worshipping
      the new teaching, I shall be blest indeed.

      good you are! How tenderly do you touch the core of my own secret thought,
      making my whole spirit vibrate to the old ambition, and my memory tremble

      And that reminds me, dearest, of what in my mad vanity I had nearly
      forgotten&mdash;the difference between our positions in the world. You are
      a rich woman; I, as you know, am very poor. It was different, perhaps,
      when I was an honoured member of the Church, with all its prizes and
      honours before me; I certainly felt it to be different, though the
      disparity always existed. But <i>now!</i> I am an outcast, a ruined man,
      without property of any kind. It would be base beyond measure to think of
      dragging you down to my present level; and, remember, I have now no
      opportunity to rise. If you linked your lot with mine, all the world would
      think that I loved you, not for your dear self, but for your gold; they
      would despise me, and think you were insane. No, dearest, I have thought
      it sadly over, again and again, and I see that it is hopeless. I have lost
      you for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you receive this, I shall be on my way to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the very writing of that word thrills me, as if there were still magic
      in the name that witched the world! Rome! the City of the Martyrs! the
      City of the Church! the City of the Dead! Her glory is laid low, her pride
      is dust and ashes, her voice is senile and old, and yet... the name, the
      mighty deathless name, one to conjure with yet. Sometimes, in my spiritual
      despair, I hear a voice whispering in my ear that one word &lsquo;Rome&rsquo;; and I
      seem to hear a mighty music, and a cry of rejoicing, and to see a veiled
      Figure arising with the keys of all the creeds,&mdash;behind her on the
      right her handmaid Science, behind her on the left her handmaid Art, and
      over her the effulgence of the new-risen sun of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if such a dream were real, were it not possible, my Alma, that you and
      I might enter the new Temple, not as man and wife, but as sister and
      brother? There was something after all in that old idea of the consecrated
      priest and the vestal virgin. I often think with St. Paul that there is
      too much marrying and giving in marriage. &lsquo;Brother and sister&rsquo; sounds
      sweetly, does it not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgive my wild words. I hardly know what I am writing. Your loving letter
      has stirred all the fountains of my spirit, your kindness has made me
      ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You shall hear from me again, from the very heart of the Seven Hills!
      Meantime, God bless you!&mdash;Ever your faithful and devoted,
    </p>
    <p>
      Ambrose Bradley.
    </p>

      <i>Alma Cram to Ambrose Bradley.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>e true to your old
      dream, dearest Ambrose, and remember that in its fruition lies <i>my</i>
      only chance of happiness. Do not talk of unworthiness or unfitness; you
      are cruel to me when you distrust yourself. Will you be very angry if I
      tell you a secret? Will you forgive me if I say to you that even now the
      place where you shall preach the good tidings is rising from the ground,
      and that in a little while, when you return, it will be ready to welcome
      its master? But there, I have said too much. If there is anything more you
      would know, you must guess it, dearest! Enough to say that you have
      friends who love you, and who are not idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I thought you meant what you said in your last I should indeed despair;
      but it was the shadow of that abominable Schopenhauer who spoke, and not
      my Abelard. To tell me that I am rich, and you are poor&mdash;as if even a
      <i>mountain</i> of money, high as Ararat, could separate those whom God
      has joined! To talk of the world&rsquo;s opinion, the people&rsquo;s misconception&mdash;as
      if the poor things who crawl on the ground could alter the lives of those
      who soar with living thoughts to heaven! Get thee behind me, Schopenhauer!
      When any voice, however like his own, talks of the overthrow of the man I
      love, I only smile. I know better than to be deceived by a trick of the
      ventriloquist. You and I know, my Ambrose, that you have not been
      overthrown at all&mdash;that you have not fallen, but risen&mdash;how
      high, the world shall know in a very little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, gather up strength, both of the body and the mind. Drink
      strength from the air of the holy city, and come back to wear your
      priestly robes. Your dream will be realised, be sure of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you think to daunt me when you say that I must not be your wife? Do you
      think your handmaid cares so long as she may serve at your feet? Call her
      by what name you please, spouse or sister, is it not all the same? Your
      hope is my hope, your country my country, your God my God&mdash;now and
      for ever. Only let us labour together earnestly, truthfully, patiently,
      and all will be well.&mdash;Yours always faithfully and affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      Alma.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
